Type Method
generateStaticMesh(positions:faceIndices:)
Generate a static collision mesh. The triangle mesh is pre-processed into an optimized format before being used by the physics engine. The pre-processing step can take significant time if the position counts are large. To minimize this cost, the position count should be as small as possible. The returned ShapeResource can only be used under the following circumstances:
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
nonisolated static func generateStaticMesh(
    positions: [SIMD3<Float>],
    faceIndices: [UInt16]
) async throws -> ShapeResource
Parameters
positions
An array of vertex positions containing discrete points on the mesh.
faceIndices
An array of integers used to index into the position array. 3 indices per polygon are used to define a polygon in the mesh.
Discussion
This shape can only be used with PhysicsBodyMode.static and not .dynamic or .kinematic.
This shape cannot be used with CollisionComponent.Mode.trigger.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
