RealityRenderer.CameraOutput.RelativeViewport
Structure defining a viewport for rendering with a camera.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct RelativeViewport
Overview
The units are relative to output texture size. To map normalized-device coordinates to the whole texture:
viewport = RealityRenderer.CameraOutput.RelativeViewport(originX: 0.0, originY: 0.0, width: 1.0, height: 1.0)
Assigning values more than 1.0 to CameraOutput.width or CameraOutput.height allows extra stretching in horizontal and vertical directions.
Assigning values less than 0.0 to CameraOutput.originX or CameraOutput.originY allows shifting viewport into negative X and negative Y direction.
