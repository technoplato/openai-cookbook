Instance Method
copyAsync(to:completionHandler:)
Asynchronously copies texture data to another texture.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor @preconcurrency
func copyAsync(
    to texture: MTLTexture,
    completionHandler: @escaping @MainActor ((Error)?) -> Void
)
Parameters
texture
Target texture for copying the data. It must have the same width and height as the TextureResource, and .shaderWrite usage.
completionHandler
A closure called after once copy has completed, with nil error if succeeded.
Discussion
This function is asynchronous. It returns immediately and runs in the background, calling completionHandler when it finishes or errors. This method copies all available mipmap sizes to texture.
Even though semantic is an optional, it is recommended that you provide a value. Specifying a semantic for this texture resource enables RealityKit to select an appropriate pixel format for the target texture.
