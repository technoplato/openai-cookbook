func draggable<V, T>(
    _ payload: @autoclosure @escaping () -> T,
    @ViewBuilder preview: () -> V
) -> some View where V : View, T : Transferable
Parameters
payload
A closure that returns a single class instance or a value conforming to Transferable that represents the draggable data from this view.
preview
A View to use as the source for the dragging preview, once the drag operation has begun. The preview is centered over the source view.
Return Value
A view that activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation, beginning with user gesture input.
Discussion
Applying the draggable(_:preview:) modifier adds the appropriate gestures for drag and drop to this view. When a drag operation begins, a rendering of preview is generated and used as the preview image.
var title: String
var body: some View {

        .draggable(title) {
