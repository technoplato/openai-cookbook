func symmetricDifference(_ other: Self) -> Self
Parameters
other
An option set.
Return Value
A new option set with only the elements contained in either this set or other, but not in both.

Option Set
let rawValue: UInt32
The raw value for this collision group.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Compares two collision groups for inequality, return true if they are different.
typealias Element
The type of element that this option set can hold.
var isEmpty: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the set has no elements.
let rawValue: UInt32
The raw value for this collision group.
func contains(Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a given element is a member of the option set.
Available when Self is Self.Element.
func formIntersection(Self)
Removes all elements of this option set that are not also present in the given set.
Available when RawValue conforms to FixedWidthInteger.
func formSymmetricDifference(Self)
Replaces this set with a new set containing all elements contained in either this set or the given set, but not in both.
Available when RawValue conforms to FixedWidthInteger.
func formUnion(Self)
Inserts the elements of another set into this option set.
Available when RawValue conforms to FixedWidthInteger.
func insert(Self.Element) -> (inserted: Bool, memberAfterInsert: Self.Element)
Adds the given element to the option set if it is not already a member.
Available when Self is Self.Element.
func intersection(Self) -> Self
Returns a new option set with only the elements contained in both this set and the given set.
func isDisjoint(with: Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set has no members in common with the given set.
func isStrictSubset(of: Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether this set is a strict subset of the given set.
func isStrictSuperset(of: Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether this set is a strict superset of the given set.
func isSubset(of: Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set is a subset of another set.
func isSuperset(of: Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the set is a superset of the given set.
func remove(Self.Element) -> Self.Element?
Removes the given element and all elements subsumed by it.
Available when Self is Self.Element.
func subtract(Self)
Removes the elements of the given set from this set.
func subtracting(Self) -> Self
Returns a new set containing the elements of this set that do not occur in the given set.
func union(Self) -> Self
Returns a new option set of the elements contained in this set, in the given set, or in both.
func update(with: Self.Element) -> Self.Element?
Inserts the given element into the set.
Available when Self is Self.Element.
typealias ArrayLiteralElement
The type of the elements of an array literal.
typealias RawValue
The raw type that can be used to represent all values of the conforming type.
