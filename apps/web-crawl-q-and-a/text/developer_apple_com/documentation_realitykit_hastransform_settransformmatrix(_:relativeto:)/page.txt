Instance Method
setTransformMatrix(_:relativeTo:)
Sets the transform of the entity relative to the given reference entity using a 4x4 matrix representation.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func setTransformMatrix(
    _ transform: float4x4,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
transform
A 4x4 transform matrix, given relative to referenceEntity.
referenceEntity
The entity that defines a frame of reference. Set this to nil to indicate world space.
Discussion
The Transform component can’t represent all transforms that a general 4x4 matrix can represent. Setting a transform using a 4x4 matrix is therefore a lossy event that might result in certain transformations, like shear, being dropped.

Using a Matrix
func transformMatrix(relativeTo: Entity?) -> float4x4
Gets the 4 x 4 transform matrix of an entity relative to the given entity.
