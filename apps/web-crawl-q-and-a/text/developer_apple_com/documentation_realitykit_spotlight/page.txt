class SpotLight
Overview
During an AR session, RealityKit automatically lights your virtual objects to match real-world lighting. You can also explicitly add virtual lights that act upon your virtual content. This is typically most useful outside of an AR session (with the view’s cameraMode property set to ARView.CameraMode.nonAR).
A RealityKit scene can contain up to eight dynamic lights, which are SpotLight, PointLight, and DirectionalLight entities. This limit doesn’t include light from image-based lighting.
