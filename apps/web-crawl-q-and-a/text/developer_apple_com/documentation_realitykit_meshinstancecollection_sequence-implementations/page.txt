Sequence Implementations
Topics
Structures
struct Iterator
A type that provides the sequence’s iteration interface and encapsulates its iteration state.
Instance Properties
var lazy: LazySequence<Self>
A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as map and filter, are implemented lazily.
var publisher: Publishers.Sequence<Self, Never>
var underestimatedCount: Int
A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the sequence, calculated nondestructively.
Instance Methods
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
If lhs is ordered before rhs in the ordering described by the given sequence of SortComparators
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func drop(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> DropWhileSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence by skipping the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy the given predicate.
func dropFirst(Int) -> DropFirstSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.
func dropLast(Int) -> [Self.Element]
Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of final elements.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence of pairs (n, x), where n represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and x represents an element of the sequence.
func filter(Predicate<Self.Element>) throws -> [Self.Element]
Beta
func filter((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns an array containing, in order, the elements of the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> SegmentOfResult) rethrows -> [SegmentOfResult.Element]
Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
func forEach((Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows
Calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a for-in loop.
func formatted<S>(S) -> S.FormatOutput
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
func makeIterator() -> MeshInstanceCollection.Iterator
Returns an iterator over the elements of this sequence.
func map<T>((Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func prefix(Int) -> PrefixSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the sequence.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns a sequence containing the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy the given predicate.
func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) throws -> ()) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reversed() -> [Self.Element]
Returns an array containing the elements of this sequence in reverse order.
func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
func shuffled<T>(using: inout T) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
func sorted(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func sorted<Comparator>(using: Comparator) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given comparator to compare elements.
func sorted<S, Comparator>(using: S) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given array of SortComparators to compare elements.
func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func suffix(Int) -> [Self.Element]
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the sequence.
func withContiguousStorageIfAvailable<R>((UnsafeBufferPointer<Self.Element>) throws -> R) rethrows -> R?
Executes a closure on the sequence’s contiguous storage.
