typealias Indices
A type that represents the indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection.
var endIndex: Int
The position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
var indices: DefaultIndices<Self>
The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
Available when Indices is DefaultIndices<Self>.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the position immediately after the given index.
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
