Instance Method
flatMap(_:)
Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.

func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>(_ transform: (Self.Element) throws -> SegmentOfResult) rethrows -> [SegmentOfResult.Element] where SegmentOfResult : Sequence
Parameters
transform
A closure that accepts an element of this sequence as its argument and returns a sequence or collection.
Return Value
The resulting flattened array.
Overview
Use this method to receive a single-level collection when your transformation produces a sequence or collection for each element.
In this example, note the difference in the result of using map and flatMap with a transformation that returns an array.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]


let mapped = numbers.map { Array(repeating: $0, count: $0) }
// [[1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]]


let flatMapped = numbers.flatMap { Array(repeating: $0, count: $0) }
// [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
In fact, s.flatMap(transform) is equivalent to Array(s.map(transform).joined()).
Complexity: O(m + n), where n is the length of this sequence and m is the length of the result.

Transforming a Sequence
func map<T>((Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) throws -> ()) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
var lazy: LazySequence<Self>
A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as map and filter, are implemented lazily.
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
