Instance Property
blendLayer
The order in which the framework composites the animation.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var blendLayer: Int32 { get set }
Discussion
The framework applies multiple animations on the same target in ascending order of this property’s value. Animations in a lower layer run before animations in a higher layer. Animations that share the same value apply in the order that they execute.

Configuring the Animation
var name: String
A textual name for the animation.
var bindTarget: BindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
var jointNames: [String]
Joint names that define the joints in the skeletal pose.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isScaleAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether that animation interpolates changes to the target’s size.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isRotationAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation interpolates rotational changes.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isTranslationAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation interpolates changes to the target object’s position.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isAdditive: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation blends additively with concurrent animations.
