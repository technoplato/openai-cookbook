func lineLimit(
    _ limit: Int,
    reservesSpace: Bool
) -> some View
Parameters
limit
The line limit.
reservesSpace
Whether text reserves space so that it always occupies the height required to display the specified number of lines.
Discussion
Use this modifier to specify a limit to the lines that a Text or a vertical TextField may occupy. If passed a value of true for the reservesSpace parameter, and the text of such views occupies less space than the provided limit, that view expands to occupy the minimum number of lines. When the text occupies more space than the provided limit, a Text view truncates its content while a TextField becomes scrollable.
GroupBox {
    Text("Title")
        .font(.headline)
        .lineLimit(2, reservesSpace: true)
    Text("Subtitle")
        .font(.subheadline)
        .lineLimit(4, reservesSpace: true)
}
