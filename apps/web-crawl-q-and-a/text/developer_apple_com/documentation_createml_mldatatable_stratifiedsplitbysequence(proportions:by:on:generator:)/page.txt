func stratifiedSplitBySequence<RNG>(
    proportions: [Double],
    by sequenceIdentifierColumn: String,
    on column: String,
    generator: inout RNG
) throws -> MLDataTable where RNG : RandomNumberGenerator
Parameters
proportions
An array of values on [0,1] specifying the proprtions in each partition. Automatically normalized to 1.
sequenceIdentifierColumn
The sequence identifier column in an MLDataTable to identify rows of a sequence.
column
The column in an MLDataTable being stratified on.
generator
User-defined RandomNumberGenerator to use in stratification.
Return Value
A new MLDataTable with an additional partition column with the index of the partition for each row.
Discussion
The proportions specified will be applied uniformly to each label being partitioned on.
