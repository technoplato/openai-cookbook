func drawingGroup(
    opaque: Bool = false,
    colorMode: ColorRenderingMode = .nonLinear
) -> some View
Parameters
opaque
A Boolean value that indicates whether the image is opaque. The default is false; if set to true, the alpha channel of the image must be 1.
colorMode
One of the working color space and storage formats defined in ColorRenderingMode. The default is ColorRenderingMode/nonLinear.
Return Value
A view that composites this view’s contents into an offscreen image before display.
Discussion
The drawingGroup(opaque:colorMode:) modifier flattens a subtree of views into a single view before rendering it.
In the example below, the contents of the view are composited to a single bitmap; the bitmap is then displayed in place of the view:
VStack {
    ZStack {
        Text("DrawingGroup")
            .foregroundColor(.black)
            .padding(20)
            .background(Color.red)
        Text("DrawingGroup")
            .blur(radius: 2)
    }
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .compositingGroup()
    .opacity(1.0)
}
 .background(Color.white)
 .drawingGroup()
Note
Views backed by native platform views may not render into the image. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
