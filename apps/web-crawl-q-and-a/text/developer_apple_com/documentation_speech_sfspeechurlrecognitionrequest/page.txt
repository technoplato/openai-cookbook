Listing 1 Getting a speech recognizer and making a recognition request
func recognizeFile(url: URL) {
    // Create a speech recognizer associated with the user's default language.
    guard let myRecognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer() else {
        // The system doesn't support the user's default language.
        return
    }
    
    guard myRecognizer.isAvailable else {
        // The recognizer isn't available.
        return
    }
    
    // Create and execute a speech recognition request for the audio file at the URL.
    let request = SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest(url: url)
    myRecognizer.recognitionTask(with: request) { (result, error) in
        guard let result else {
            // Recognition failed, so check the error for details and handle it.
            return
        }
        
        // Print the speech transcription with the highest confidence that the
        // system recognized.
        if result.isFinal {
            print(result.bestTranscription.formattedString)
