enum SortOrder
Topics
Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.SortOrder, ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.SortOrder) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case decreasingAge
Particles emitted earlier are rendered before particles emitted more recently.
case decreasingDepth
Particles closer to camera are rendered first
case decreasingID
Particles with higher IDs are rendered first
case increasingAge
Particles emitted more recently are rendered before particles emitted earlier.
case increasingDepth
Particles further from camera are rendered first.
case increasingID
Particles with lower IDs are rendered first
case unsorted
Particles are not sorted; they may be rendered in any order.
Initializers
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
