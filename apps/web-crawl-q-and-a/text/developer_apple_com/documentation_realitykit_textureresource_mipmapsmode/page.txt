Enumeration
TextureResource.MipmapsMode
An enumeration used to specify how mipmaps are allocated and generated for this texture.

iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum MipmapsMode
Topics
Specifying Allocation and Generation
case none
Do not allocate mipmaps for the texture resource.
case allocateAll
Allocate memory for all mipmaps, but don’t generate them.
case allocateAndGenerateAll
Allocate and generate all mipmaps for the texture resource.
Comparing Enumeration Values
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the raw value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func == (TextureResource.MipmapsMode, TextureResource.MipmapsMode) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances aren’t equal.
