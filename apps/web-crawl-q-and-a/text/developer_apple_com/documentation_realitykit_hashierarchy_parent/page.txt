Discussion
An entity has at most one parent entity. If an entity isn’t part of a hierarchy, or if it is a root entity, the parent property is nil.
Use the setParent(_:preservingWorldTransform:) method to change an entity’s parent. Use the removeFromParent(preservingWorldTransform:) method to remove the parent. These methods automatically update the corresponding children collections of the new and old parent.
