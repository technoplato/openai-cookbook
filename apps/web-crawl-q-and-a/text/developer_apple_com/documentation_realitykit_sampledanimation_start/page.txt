var start: TimeInterval { get set }
Discussion
When calculating the visual beginning of a sampled animation, the framework first evaluates this property, and then applies the optional trimStart, in seconds.
The framework requires this property to contain an integer multiple of frameInterval. Note that the value of this property can be irrational because frame interval is of type TimeInterval.

var frameInterval: Float
The duration within the animation timeline for each frame in the frames array.
var end: TimeInterval
An integer multiple of the frame interval at which the animation stops.
var speed: Float
A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
var delay: TimeInterval
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
var duration: TimeInterval
The total playback time of the animation.
var offset: TimeInterval
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
var trimDuration: TimeInterval?
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
var trimStart: TimeInterval?
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
var trimEnd: TimeInterval?
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.
func trimmed(start: TimeInterval?, end: TimeInterval?, duration: TimeInterval?) -> Self
Edits the animation duration according to the specified time.
