Instance Method
split(maxSplits:omittingEmptySubsequences:whereSeparator:)
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.

func split(
    maxSplits: Int = Int.max,
    omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool = true,
    whereSeparator isSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]
Parameters
maxSplits
The maximum number of times to split the sequence, or one less than the number of subsequences to return. If maxSplits + 1 subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original sequence containing the remaining elements. maxSplits must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is Int.max.
omittingEmptySubsequences
If false, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each pair of consecutive elements satisfying the isSeparator predicate and for each element at the start or end of the sequence satisfying the isSeparator predicate. If true, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is true.
isSeparator
A closure that returns true if its argument should be used to split the sequence; otherwise, false.
Return Value
An array of subsequences, split from this sequence’s elements.
Overview
The following examples show the effects of the maxSplits and omittingEmptySubsequences parameters when splitting a string using a closure that matches spaces. The first use of split returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.
let line = "BLANCHE:   I don't want realism. I want magic!"
print(line.split(whereSeparator: { $0 == " " })
          .map(String.init))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
The second example passes 1 for the maxSplits parameter, so the original string is split just once, into two new strings.
print(
   line.split(maxSplits: 1, whereSeparator: { $0 == " " })
                  .map(String.init))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "  I don\'t want realism. I want magic!"]"
The final example passes true for the allowEmptySlices parameter, so the returned array contains empty strings where spaces were repeated.
print(
    line.split(
        omittingEmptySubsequences: false,
        whereSeparator: { $0 == " " }
    ).map(String.init))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "", "", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
