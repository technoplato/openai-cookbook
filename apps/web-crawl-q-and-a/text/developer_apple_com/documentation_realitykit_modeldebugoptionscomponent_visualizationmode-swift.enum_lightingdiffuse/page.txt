ModelDebugOptionsComponent.VisualizationMode.lightingDiffuse
A mode that displays the intensity of indirect light hitting the entity as its surface color.

case lightingDiffuse
Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of lightingDiffuse to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw the intensity of indirect, ambient lighting falling on the entity as its surface color. RealityKit represents the intensity of indirect light as a grayscale value from black (0.0) to white (1.0).
RealityKit calculates diffuse lighting for entities with a SimpleMaterial and for entities imported from a USDZ file. For other entities, this option has no effect.
Here’s how to enable roughness visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .lightingDiffuse)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```


![A screenshot showing two virtual TVs from an AR app. The TV on the
left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right is drawn in shades of gray, which is a representation of
the amount of indirect light falling on the TV at each
point.](ModelDebugOptionsComponent-VisualizationMode-swift-enum-lightingDiffuse-1)
