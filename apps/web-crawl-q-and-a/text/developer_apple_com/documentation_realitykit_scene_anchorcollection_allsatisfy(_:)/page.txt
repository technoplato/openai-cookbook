Instance Method
allSatisfy(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.

func allSatisfy(_ predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the passed element satisfies a condition.
Return Value
true if the sequence contains only elements that satisfy predicate; otherwise, false.
Overview
The following code uses this method to test whether all the names in an array have at least five characters:
let names = ["Sofia", "Camilla", "Martina", "Mateo", "Nicolás"]
let allHaveAtLeastFive = names.allSatisfy({ $0.count >= 5 })
// allHaveAtLeastFive == true
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
var first: Self.Element?
The first element of the collection.
func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
