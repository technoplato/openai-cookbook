Structure
ModelSortGroupComponent
A component that allows an entity’s models to be rendered in an explicit order relative to the models of other entities in the same sort group. If this component is on an entity, then it must belong to a sort group.

Topics
Initializers
init(group: ModelSortGroup, order: Int32)
Instance Properties
var group: ModelSortGroup
Group membership is strictly defined by having an identical group to other entities in the scene. This is not hierarchical; membership only applies to the entity which owns this component.
var order: Int32
The draw order of the model relative to other models in its group. Lower value means the model draws earlier.
