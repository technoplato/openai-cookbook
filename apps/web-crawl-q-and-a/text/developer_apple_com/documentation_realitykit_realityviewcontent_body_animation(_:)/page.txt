func animation(_ animation: Animation?) -> some View
Deprecated
Use withAnimation or animation(_:value:) instead.
Parameters
animation
The animation to apply to animatable values within this view.
Return Value
A view that wraps this view and applies animation to all animatable values used within the view.
Discussion
Use this modifier on leaf views rather than container views. The animation applies to all child views within this view; calling animation(_:) on a container view can lead to unbounded scope.

This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
