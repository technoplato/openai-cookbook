func handlesExternalEvents(
    preferring: Set<String>,
    allowing: Set<String>
) -> some View
Parameters
preferring
A Set of Strings that are checked to see if they are contained in the targetContentIdenfifier to see if the Scene this View is in prefers to handle the Exernal Event. The empty Set and empty Strings never match. The String value “*” always matches. The String comparisons are case/diacritic insensitive
allowing
A Set of Strings that are checked to see if they are contained in the targetContentIdenfifier to see if the Scene this View is in allows handling the External Event. The empty Set and empty Strings never match. The String value “*” always matches.
Discussion
If no modifier is set in any Views within a Scene, the behavior is platform dependent. On macOS, a new Scene will be created to use for the External Event. On iOS, the system will choose an existing Scene to use.
On platforms that only allow a single Window/Scene, this method is ignored, and incoming External Events are always routed to the existing single Scene.
