Case
ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectNotFlippable
It is not recommended to flip this object since is is unlikely the algorithm will be able to stitch the flipped orientation. This is usually due to feature-less, low-texture objects. In this case, multiple passes at different heights leaving object at its original orientation are recommended instead of flipping.
