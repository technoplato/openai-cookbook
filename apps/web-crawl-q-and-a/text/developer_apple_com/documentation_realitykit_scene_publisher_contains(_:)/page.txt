func contains(_ output: Self.Output) -> Publishers.Contains<Self>
Available when Output conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
output
An element to match against.
Return Value
A publisher that emits the Boolean value true when the upstream publisher emits a matching value.
Discussion
Use contains(_:) to find the first element in an upstream that’s equal to the supplied argument. The contains publisher consumes all received elements until the upstream publisher produces a matching element. Upon finding the first match, it emits true and finishes normally. If the upstream finishes normally without producing a matching element, this publisher emits false and finishes.
In the example below, the contains(_:) operator emits true the first time it receives the value 5 from the numbers.publisher, and then finishes normally.
let numbers = [-1, 5, 10, 5]
numbers.publisher
    .contains(5)
    .sink { print("\($0)") }


// Prints: "true"

Applying Matching Criteria to Elements
func contains(where: (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.ContainsWhere<Self>
Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the predicate closure.
func tryContains(where: (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryContainsWhere<Self>
Publishes a Boolean value upon receiving an element that satisfies the throwing predicate closure.
func allSatisfy((Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.AllSatisfy<Self>
Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given predicate.
func tryAllSatisfy((Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryAllSatisfy<Self>
Publishes a single Boolean value that indicates whether all received elements pass a given error-throwing predicate.
