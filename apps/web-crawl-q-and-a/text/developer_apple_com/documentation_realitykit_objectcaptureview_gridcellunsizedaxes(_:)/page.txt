func gridCellUnsizedAxes(_ axes: Axis.Set) -> some View
Parameters
axes
The dimensions in which the grid shouldn’t offer the view a share of any available space. This prevents a flexible view like a Spacer, Divider, or Color from defining the size of a row or column.
Return Value
A view that doesn’t ask an enclosing grid for extra size in one or more axes.
Discussion
Use this modifier to prevent a flexible view from taking more space on the specified axes than the other cells in a row or column require. For example, consider the following Grid that places a Divider between two rows of content:
Grid {
    GridRow {
        Text("Hello")
        Image(systemName: "globe")
    }
    Divider()
    GridRow {
        Image(systemName: "hand.wave")
        Text("World")
    }
}
The text and images all have ideal widths for their content. However, because a divider takes as much space as its parent offers, the grid fills the width of the display, expanding all the other cells to match:
You can prevent the grid from giving the divider more width than the other cells require by adding the modifier with the Axis/horizontal parameter:
Divider()
    .gridCellUnsizedAxes(.horizontal)
This restores the grid to the width that it would have without the divider:
