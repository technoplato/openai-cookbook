Protocol
TabularTransformer
A tabular transformer that transforms a data frame.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
protocol TabularTransformer : Transformer where Self.Input == DataFrame, Self.Output == DataFrame
Overview
Tabular transformers represent operations on data frames. They modify and operate on values on one or more columns.
Topics
Appending
func appending<Other>(Other) -> ComposedTabularTransformer<Self, Other>
Composes this tabular transformer with another tabular transformer.
Transforming
func callAsFunction(DataFrame, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> DataFrame
Performs the transformation on a single input.
Exporting
func export(to: URL) throws
Exports this transformer as a CoreML model.
Instance Methods
func adaptedAsEstimator() -> TabularTransformerToEstimatorAdaptor<Self>
Exposes this tabular transformer as a trivial tabular estimator.
func adaptedAsUpdatableEstimator() -> TabularTransformerToUpdatableEstimatorAdaptor<Self>
Exposes this tabular transformer as an updatable tabular estimator.
func appending<Other>(Other) -> PreprocessingSupervisedTabularEstimator<Self, Other>
Composes this transformer with a supervised tabular estimator.
Beta
func appending<Other>(Other) -> PreprocessingUpdatableTabularEstimator<Self, Other>
Composes this transformer with an updatable estimator.
Beta
func appending<Other>(Other) -> PreprocessingTabularEstimator<Self, Other>
Composes this transformer with an estimator.
Beta
func appending<Other>(Other) -> PreprocessingUpdatableSupervisedTabularEstimator<Self, Other>
Composes this transformer with an updatable supervised estimator.
Beta
func appending<Other>(Other) -> some SupervisedTabularEstimator<ComposedTabularTransformer<Self, Other.Transformer>, Other.Annotation>
Composes this transformer with a supervised tabular estimator.
func appending<Other>(Other) -> some TabularEstimator<ComposedTabularTransformer<Self, Other.Transformer>>
Compose this tabular transformer with a tabular estimator.
func export(to: URL, metadata: ModelMetadata) throws
Exports this tabular transformer as a CoreML model with userInfo.
