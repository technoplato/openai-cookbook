func focusEffectDisabled(_ disabled: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
disabled
A Boolean value that determines whether this view can display focus effects.
Return Value
A view that controls whether focus effects can be displayed in this view.
Discussion
The higher views in a view hierarchy can override the value you set on this view. In the following example, the button does not display a focus effect because the outer focusEffectDisabled(_:) modifier overrides the inner one:
HStack {
    Button("Press") {}
        .focusEffectDisabled(false)
}
.focusEffectDisabled(true)
