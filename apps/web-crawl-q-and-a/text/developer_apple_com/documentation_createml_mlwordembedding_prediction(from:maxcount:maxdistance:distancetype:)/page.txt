func prediction(
    from text: String,
    maxCount: Int = 10,
    maxDistance: Double = 2.0,
    distanceType: NLDistanceType = .cosine
) throws -> [(text: String, distance: Double)]
Parameters
text
A string in the embedding vocabulary.
maxCount
The largest number of neighboring strings.
maxDistance
The maximum allowed neighbor distance.
distanceType
The type of distance formula to use for evaluating a neighbor’s distance from the input string.
Return Value
An array of neighboring strings and their distances to the input string.
Discussion
The distance values are calculated with a formula determined by NLDistanceType, such as NLDistanceType.cosine.
