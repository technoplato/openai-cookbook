func grayscale(_ amount: Double) -> some View
Parameters
amount
The intensity of grayscale to apply from 0.0 to less than 1.0. Values closer to 0.0 are more colorful, and values closer to 1.0 are less colorful.
Return Value
A view that adds a grayscale effect to this view.
Discussion
A grayscale effect reduces the intensity of colors in this view.
The example below shows a series of red squares with their grayscale effect increasing from 0 (reddest) to 99% (fully desaturated) in approximate 20% increments:
struct Saturation: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(0..<6) {
                Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60, alignment: .center)
                    .grayscale(Double($0) * 0.1999)
                    .overlay(Text("\(Double($0) * 0.1999 * 100, specifier: "%.4f")%"),
                             alignment: .bottom)
                    .border(Color.gray)
            }
        }
    }
}
