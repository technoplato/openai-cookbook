Instance Method
reverse()
Reverses the elements of the collection in place.

mutating func reverse()
Discussion
The following example reverses the elements of an array of characters:
var characters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "f", "é"]
characters.reverse()
print(characters)
// Prints "["é", "f", "a", "C"]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the collection.

Modifying a Shaped Array
func swapAt(Int, Int)
Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
func partition(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int
Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
func sort<Comparator>(using: Comparator)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a comparator.
func sort<S, Comparator>(using: S)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a sequence of comparators.
func sort(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool)
Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func shuffle()
Shuffles the collection in place.
func shuffle<T>(using: inout T)
Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
func withContiguousMutableStorageIfAvailable<R>((inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>) -> R) -> R?
Executes a closure on the collection’s contiguous storage.
