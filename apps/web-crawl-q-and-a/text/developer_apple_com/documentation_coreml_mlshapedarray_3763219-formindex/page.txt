Instance Method
formIndex(_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.

func formIndex(
    _ i: inout Int,
    offsetBy distance: Int,
    limitedBy limit: Int
) -> Bool
Parameters
i
A valid index of the collection.
distance
The distance to offset i. distance must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol.
limit
A valid index of the collection to use as a limit. If distance > 0, a limit that is less than i has no effect. Likewise, if distance < 0, a limit that is greater than i has no effect.
Return Value
true if i has been offset by exactly distance steps without going beyond limit; otherwise, false. When the return value is false, the value of i is equal to limit.
Discussion
The value passed as distance must not offset i beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as limit prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the absolute value of distance.

func ranges<C>(of: C) -> [Range<Int>]
Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence within the collection.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.
func firstRange<C>(of: C) -> Range<Int>?
Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given collection within this collection.
