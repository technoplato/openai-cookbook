func first(where predicate: @escaping (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.FirstWhere<Self>
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element as a parameter and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether to publish the element.
Return Value
A publisher that only publishes the first element of a stream that satisfies the predicate.
Discussion
Use Publisher/first(where:) to republish only the first element of a stream that satisfies a closure you specify. The publisher ignores all elements after the first element that satisfies the closure and finishes normally. If this publisher doesn’t receive any elements, it finishes without publishing.
In the example below, the provided closure causes the Publishers/FirstWhere publisher to republish the first received element that’s greater than 0, then finishes normally.
let numbers = (-10...10)
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .first { $0 > 0 }
    .sink { print("\($0)") }


// Prints: "1"
