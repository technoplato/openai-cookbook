func contentShape<S>(
    _ kind: ContentShapeKinds,
    _ shape: S,
    eoFill: Bool = false
) -> some View where S : Shape
Parameters
kind
The kinds to apply to this content shape.
shape
The shape to use.
eoFill
A Boolean that indicates whether the shape is interpreted with the even-odd winding number rule.
Return Value
A view that uses the given shape for the specified kind.
Discussion
The content shape has a variety of uses. You can control the kind of the content shape by specifying one in kind. For example, the following example only sets the focus ring shape of the view, without affecting its shape for hit-testing:
MyFocusableView()
    .contentShape(.focusEffect, Circle())
