Overview
Use a model collection to access the models from a Core ML Model Deployment. For example, you can use a model collection to replace one or more of your app’s built-in models with a newer version.
To access the newest model collection from a deployment, call the beginAccessing(identifier:completionHandler:) type method. Your app can also get a notification when Core ML receives an update to a model collection (see didChangeNotification).
