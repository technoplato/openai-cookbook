Instance Property
minimumObjectSize
The minimum radius of the tracked shape’s bounding circle.

var minimumObjectSize: Float { get set }
Deprecated
Use objectMinimumNormalizedRadius instead.
Discussion
Set the minimum size to filter out noise and small objects. The default value is 0, which means to apply no filtering.
Changing this property value from frame to frame can produce erratic trajectories because objects either disappear or are added to the tracking based on this filtering.
Specify the size in normalized (0.0 to 1.0) coordinates.
