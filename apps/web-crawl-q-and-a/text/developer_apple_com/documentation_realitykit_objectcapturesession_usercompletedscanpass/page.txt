Instance Property
userCompletedScanPass
This property starts out false at the start of a capture and will switch to true when the user has moved the device in a full circular scan pass around the bounding box of the target object and captured enough data to fill completely the capture dial.

It is reset to false in a given capture session whenever either:
beginNewScanPassAfterFlip() is called to start a new scan pass for a flipped object. or
beginNewScanPass() is called to start a new scan pass on an unflipped object.
