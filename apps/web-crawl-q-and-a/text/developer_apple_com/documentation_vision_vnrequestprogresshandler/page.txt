typealias VNRequestProgressHandler = (VNRequest, Double, Error?) -> Void
Parameters
request
The completed Vision request. The results of the request, if no error occurred, reside in the results array of the request.
fractionCompleted
The fraction of the request that is completed, reported between 0.0 and 1.0. If the indeterminate property is set, this value is undefined.
error
The error that caused the request to fail, or nil if the request completed successfully.
Discussion
Vision may populate the results array in the request with partial data, before all results are ready.
Note
The Vision framework may call the progress handler on a different dispatch queue from the thread on which you initiated the original request, so ensure that your handler can execute asynchronously, in a thread-safe manner.
