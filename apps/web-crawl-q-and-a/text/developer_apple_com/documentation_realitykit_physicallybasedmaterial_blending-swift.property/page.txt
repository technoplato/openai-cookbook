Discussion
Use this property to specify whether an entity is opaque or transparent. To create an entity that’s opaque, assign PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Blending.opaque to this property.
material.blending = .opaque
To create a translucent or transparent object using a single opacity value for the entire material, initialize PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Blending.transparent(opacity:) using a Float value.
material.blending = .transparent(opacity: .init(floatLiteral:0.5))
To use a UV-mapped grayscale image texture to specify different opacity values for different parts of an entity, initialize PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Blending.transparent(opacity:) using a texture. If you provide a color image, RealityKit only uses the intensity of the red channel.
if let opacityResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_opacity") {
    let opacityMap = MaterialParameterTypes.Texture(opacityResource)
    material.blending = .transparent(opacity: .init(texture: opacityMap))
}
