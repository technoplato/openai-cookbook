func alert<E, A>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    error: E?,
    @ViewBuilder actions: () -> A
) -> some View where E : LocalizedError, A : View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to false and dismisses.
error
An optional localized Error that is used to generate the alert’s title. The system passes the contents to the modifier’s closures. You use this data to populate the fields of an alert that you create that the system displays to the user.
actions
A ViewBuilder returning the alert’s actions.
Discussion
In the example below, a form conditionally presents an alert depending upon the value of an error. When the error value isn’t nil, the system presents an alert with an “OK” action.
The title of the alert is inferred from the error’s errorDescription.
struct TicketPurchase: View {
    @State private var error: TicketPurchaseError? = nil
    @State private var showAlert = false


    var body: some View {
        TicketForm(showAlert: $showAlert, error: $error)
            .alert(isPresented: $showAlert, error: error) {
                Button("OK") {
                    // Handle acknowledgement.
                }
            }
    }
}
All actions in an alert dismiss the alert after the action runs. The default button is shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the KeyboardShortcut/defaultAction keyboard shortcut.
The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.
If no actions are present, the system includes a standard “OK” action. No default cancel action is provided. If you want to show a cancel action, use a button with a role of ButtonRole/cancel.
On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, alerts only support controls with labels that are Text. Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
This modifier creates a Text view for the title on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
