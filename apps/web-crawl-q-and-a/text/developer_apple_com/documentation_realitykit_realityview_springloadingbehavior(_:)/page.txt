Whether spring loading is enabled or not. If unspecified, the default behavior is .automatic.
Discussion
Spring loading refers to a view being activated during a drag and drop interaction. On iOS this can occur when pausing briefly on top of a view with dragged content. On macOS this can occur with similar brief pauses or on pressure-sensitive systems by “force clicking” during the drag. This has no effect on tvOS or watchOS.
This is commonly used with views that have a navigation or presentation effect, allowing the destination to be revealed without pausing the drag interaction. For example, a button that reveals a list of folders that a dragged item can be dropped onto.
Button {
    showFolders = true
} label: {
    Label("Show Folders", systemImage: "folder")
}
.springLoadingBehavior(.enabled)
Unlike disabled(_:), this modifier overrides the value set by an ancestor view rather than being unioned with it. For example, the below button would allow spring loading:
HStack {
    Button {
        showFolders = true
    } label: {
        Label("Show Folders", systemImage: "folder")
    }
    .springLoadingBehavior(.enabled)


    ...
}
.springLoadingBehavior(.disabled)
