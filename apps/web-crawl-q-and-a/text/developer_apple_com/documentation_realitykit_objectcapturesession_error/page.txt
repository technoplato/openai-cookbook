Enumeration Cases
case cancelled
The user requested that the session be canceled and the session is now canceled. Another session may now be created.
case directoryNotEmpty(URL)
We cannot continue a pre-existing capture, so if an output directory is provided that already exists and it is not empty, this error is thrown.
case insufficientStorage(requiredBytes: Int64)
The session can’t be started since there is not enough storage space in the provided directories.
case sensorFailed
There was an ARKit failure in one of the sensors.
case trackingFailed
There was an unrecoverable error related to tracking the object or environment.
