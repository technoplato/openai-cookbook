Discussion
RealityKit supports loading entities from USD (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) and Reality files (.reality).
When building your app, Xcode automatically converts any Reality Composer projects (.rcproject) in the selected target into Reality files, which it then copies into your app’s bundle.
For more information on loading entities, see Loading Entities from a File.
name: The base name of the file to load, omitting the file extension.
bundle: The bundle containing the file. Use nil to search the app’s main bundle.
