Discussion
RealityKit supports loading entities from USD (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) and Reality files (.reality).
When building your app, Xcode automatically converts any Reality Composer projects (.rcproject) in the selected target into Reality files, which it then copies into your app’s bundle.
For more information on loading entities, see Loading Entities from a File.
resourceName: A unique name to assign to the loaded resource, for use in network synchronization.
