var regionOfInterest: CGRect { get set }
Discussion
The rectangle is normalized to the dimensions of the processed image. Its origin is specified relative to the image's lower-left corner.
The default value is { { 0, 0 }, { 1, 1 } }.
Important
The request will fail to perform if you set this property to a rectangle outside the normalized coordinate space.
