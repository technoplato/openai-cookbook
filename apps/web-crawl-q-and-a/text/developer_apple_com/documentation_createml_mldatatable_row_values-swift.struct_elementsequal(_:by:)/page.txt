Instance Method
elementsEqual(_:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(
    _ other: OtherSequence,
    by areEquivalent: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areEquivalent
A predicate that returns true if its two arguments are equivalent; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if this sequence and other contain equivalent items, using areEquivalent as the equivalence test; otherwise, false.
Discussion
At least one of the sequences must be finite.
The predicate must be a equivalence relation over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
areEquivalent(a, a) is always true. (Reflexivity)
areEquivalent(a, b) implies areEquivalent(b, a). (Symmetry)
If areEquivalent(a, b) and areEquivalent(b, c) are both true, then areEquivalent(a, c) is also true. (Transitivity)
Complexity
O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.
