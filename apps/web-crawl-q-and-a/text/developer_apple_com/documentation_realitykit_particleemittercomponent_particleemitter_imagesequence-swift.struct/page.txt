Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.ImageSequence, ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.ImageSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init()
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
var animationMode: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.ImageSequence.AnimationRepeatMode
How the effect timeline is played.
var columnCount: Int
Number of columns in the sprite sheet.
var frameRate: Float
Number of sprite sheet frames to play per second.
var frameRateVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range (in frames per second) from which a value is randomly selected to offset frameRate.
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
var initialFrame: Int
First frame of the sprite sheet animation.
var initialFrameVariation: Int
Defines a plus/minus range (in frames) from which a value is randomly selected to offset initialFrame.
var rowCount: Int
Number of rows in the sprite sheet.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
Enumerations
enum AnimationRepeatMode
Options for how the effect timeline is played, used by the animationMode property.
