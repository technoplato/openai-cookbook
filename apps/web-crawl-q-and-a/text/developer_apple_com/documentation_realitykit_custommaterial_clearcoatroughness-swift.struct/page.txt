CustomMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness
An object that defines the degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.

struct ClearcoatRoughness
Overview
An entity in RealityKit can display a clearcoat, which is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear coating, like on a car or the surface of lacquered objects. Use this object to specify a clearcoat roughness value and indicate how much the clearcoat scatters light that bounces off of it, which softens and disperses the highlights.
For information, see clearcoatRoughness.
Topics
Creating a Clearcoat Roughness Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates a clearcoat object using a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?)
Creates a clearcoat object using a single value or a texture.
init(PhysicallyBasedMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness)
Creates a custom clearcoat object from a physically based material’s clearcoat property.
Accessing Clearcoat Roughness Values
var scale: Float
The clearcoat intensity specified as a single value.
var texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?
The clearcoat intensity specified using a UV-mapped image.
typealias FloatLiteralType
