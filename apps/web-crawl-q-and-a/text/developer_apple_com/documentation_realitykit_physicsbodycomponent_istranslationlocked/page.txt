Instance Property
isTranslationLocked
A tuple of Boolean values that you use to lock the position of the physics body along any of the three axes.

var isTranslationLocked: (x: Bool, y: Bool, z: Bool)
Discussion
You can restrict movement of the body along one or more axes by setting the corresponding item in the tuple to true. For example, if you set the x and the z items in the tuple to true, then the body can move only along the y-axis. By default, movement isn’t restricted.

var isRotationLocked: (x: Bool, y: Bool, z: Bool)
