Topics
Reading and Writing
func read(from: URL) throws -> Self.Transformer
Reads the encoded transformer from a file.
func write(Self.Transformer, to: URL, overwrite: Bool) throws
Writes the encoded transformer to a file.
associatedtype Transformer : TabularTransformer
The transformer type created by this estimator.
Required
Adapting and Fitting
func adaptedAsSupervised<Annotation>(annotationColumnID: ColumnID<Annotation>) -> TabularEstimatorToSupervisedAdaptor<Self, Annotation>
Exposes this tabular estimator as a supervised tabular estimator.
func fitted(to: DataFrame, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> Self.Transformer
Fits a transformer to a data frame
Required
Encoding and Decoding
func encode(Self.Transformer, to: inout EstimatorEncoder) throws
Encodes a fitted transformer.
Required Default implementation provided.
func decode(from: inout EstimatorDecoder) throws -> Self.Transformer
Decodes a previously fitted transformer.
Required Default implementation provided.
Instance Methods
func appending<Other>(Other) -> some TabularEstimator<ComposedTabularTransformer<Self.Transformer, Other.Transformer>>
Compose this tabular estimator with another tabular estimator.
func appending<Other>(Other) -> some TabularEstimator<ComposedTabularTransformer<Self.Transformer, Other>>
Compose this tabular estimator with a tabular transformer.
func appending<Other>(Other) -> some SupervisedTabularEstimator<ComposedTabularTransformer<Self.Transformer, Other.Transformer>, Other.Annotation>
Composes this tabular estimator with a supervised tabular estimator.
func fitted(to: DataFrame) async throws -> Self.Transformer
Available when Transformer conforms to Encodable.
