func badge(_ count: Int) -> some View
Parameters
count
An integer value to display in the badge. Set the value to zero to hide the badge.
Discussion
Use a badge to convey optional, supplementary information about a view. Keep the contents of the badge as short as possible. Badges appear only in list rows, tab bars, and menus.
The following example shows a List with the value of recentItems.count represented by a badge on one of the rows:
List {
    Text("Recents")
        .badge(recentItems.count)
    Text("Favorites")
}
