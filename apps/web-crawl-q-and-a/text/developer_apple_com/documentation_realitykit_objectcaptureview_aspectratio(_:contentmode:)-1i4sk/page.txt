func aspectRatio(
    _ aspectRatio: CGFloat? = nil,
    contentMode: ContentMode
) -> some View
Parameters
aspectRatio
The ratio of width to height to use for the resulting view. Use nil to maintain the current aspect ratio in the resulting view.
contentMode
A flag that indicates whether this view fits or fills the parent context.
Return Value
A view that constrains this view’s dimensions to the aspect ratio of the given size using contentMode as its scaling algorithm.
Discussion
Use aspectRatio(_:contentMode:) to constrain a view’s dimensions to an aspect ratio specified by a doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/CoreGraphics/CGFloat using the specified content mode.
If this view is resizable, the resulting view will have aspectRatio as its aspect ratio. In this example, the purple ellipse has a 3:4 width-to-height ratio, and scales to fit its frame:
Ellipse()
    .fill(Color.purple)
    .aspectRatio(0.75, contentMode: .fit)
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    .border(Color(white: 0.75))
