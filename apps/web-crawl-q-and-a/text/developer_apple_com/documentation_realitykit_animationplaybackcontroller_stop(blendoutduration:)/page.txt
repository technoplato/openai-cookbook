func stop(blendOutDuration: TimeInterval)
Discussion
blendOutDuration: Time (in seconds) to fade out the animation before it stops.
This method has no effect if the animation is complete. After you stop the animation, the playback controller becomes invalid. Create a new one with the same resource to play the animation again.
