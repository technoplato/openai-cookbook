Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of roughness to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw that entity’s roughness value as its surface color. A high roughness value represents a surface with a matte finish, while a low roughness value represents a shiny or polished surface. When using this mode, RealityKit draws the roughness value as a grayscale value from black (0.0) to white (1.0), meaning the shinier a part of the entity is, the darker RealityKit draws it.
RealityKit calculates roughness for entities with a SimpleMaterial and for entities imported from a USDZ file. For other entities, this option has no affect.
Here’s how to enable roughness visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .roughness)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```

left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right is drawn in shades of gray which is a graphical
representation of the TV’s surface roughness.
