Instance Method
onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)
Adds an action to perform when the pointer enters, moves within, and exits the view’s bounds.

func onContinuousHover(
    coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace = .local,
    perform action: @escaping (HoverPhase) -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
coordinateSpace
The coordinate space for the location values. Defaults to CoordinateSpace/local.
action
The action to perform whenever the pointer enters, moves within, or exits the view’s bounds. The action closure passes the HoverPhase/active(_:) phase with the pointer’s coordinates if the pointer is in the view’s bounds; otherwise, it passes HoverPhase/ended.
Return Value
A view that calls action when the pointer enters, moves within, or exits the view’s bounds.
Discussion
Call this method to define a region for detecting pointer movement with the size and position of this view. The following example updates hoverLocation and isHovering to be based on the phase provided to the closure:
@State private var hoverLocation: CGPoint = .zero
@State private var isHovering = false


var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Color.red
            .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
            .onContinuousHover { phase in
                switch phase {
                case .active(let location):
                    hoverLocation = location
                    isHovering = true
                case .ended:
                    isHovering = false
                }
            }
            .overlay {
                Rectangle()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
                    .foregroundColor(isHovering ? .green : .blue)
                    .offset(x: hoverLocation.x, y: hoverLocation.y)
            }
    }
}
