Manipulating Indices
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
var indices: DefaultIndices<Self>
The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
Available when Indices is DefaultIndices<Self>.
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection. (See Collection.startIndex.)
var endIndex: Int
TThe collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument. (See Collection.endIndex.)
func firstIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the position immediately after the given index. (See Collection.index.)
func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
