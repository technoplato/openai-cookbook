Topics
Creating the Identifier
init(source: String, range: Range<Int>, timescale: Int)
Creates a temporal-segment identifier.
Getting the Properties
var durationInSeconds: TimeInterval
The segment duration in seconds.
var range: Range<Int>
The segment’s timestamp range.
var rangeInSeconds: Range<TimeInterval>
The time range in seconds.
var source: String
The segment source. For files use the full path or URL of the file.
var timescale: Int
The identifier’s timescale is the number of uniquely identifiable timestamps in a second.
Operators
static func == (TemporalSegmentIdentifier, TemporalSegmentIdentifier) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
