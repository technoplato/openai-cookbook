Accessing an Element
var scalars: [Scalar]
A computed property that generates a linear array that contains every element, or assigns the elements of an array to the shaped array’s elements.
subscript(scalarAt: Int...) -> Scalar
Accesses an element in the shaped array using a list of indices that represent a multidimensional location.
subscript<C>(scalarAt: C) -> Scalar
Accesses an element in the shaped array using a collection of indices that represent a multidimensional location.
