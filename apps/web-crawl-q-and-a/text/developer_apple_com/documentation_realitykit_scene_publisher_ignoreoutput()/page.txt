func ignoreOutput() -> Publishers.IgnoreOutput<Self>
Return Value
A publisher that ignores all upstream elements.
Discussion
Use the ignoreOutput() operator to determine if a publisher is able to complete successfully or would fail.
In the example below, the array publisher (numbers) delivers the first five of its elements successfully, as indicated by the ignoreOutput() operator. The operator consumes, but doesn’t republish the elements downstream. However, the sixth element, 0, causes the error throwing closure to catch a NoZeroValuesAllowedError that terminates the stream.
struct NoZeroValuesAllowedError: Error {}
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 6, 7, 8, 9]
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .tryFilter({ anInt in
        guard anInt != 0 else { throw NoZeroValuesAllowedError() }
        return anInt < 20
    })
    .ignoreOutput()
    .sink(receiveCompletion: {print("completion: \($0)")},
          receiveValue: {print("value \($0)")})


// Prints: "completion: failure(NoZeroValuesAllowedError())"
The output type of this publisher is Never.

Reducing Elements
func collect() -> Publishers.Collect<Self>
Collects all received elements, and emits a single array of the collection when the upstream publisher finishes.
func collect(Int) -> Publishers.CollectByCount<Self>
Collects up to the specified number of elements, and then emits a single array of the collection.
func collect<S>(Publishers.TimeGroupingStrategy<S>, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.CollectByTime<Self, S>
Collects elements by a given time-grouping strategy, and emits a single array of the collection.
func reduce<T>(T, (T, Self.Output) -> T) -> Publishers.Reduce<Self, T>
Applies a closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.
func tryReduce<T>(T, (T, Self.Output) throws -> T) -> Publishers.TryReduce<Self, T>
Applies an error-throwing closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.
