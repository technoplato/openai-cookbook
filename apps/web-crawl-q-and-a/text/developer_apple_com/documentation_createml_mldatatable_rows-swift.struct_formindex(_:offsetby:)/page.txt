Instance Method
formIndex(_:offsetBy:)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.

func formIndex(
    _ i: inout Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int
)
Parameters
i
A valid index of the collection.
distance
The distance to offset i. distance must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol.
Discussion
The value passed as distance must not offset i beyond the bounds of the collection.
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the absolute value of distance.

Manipulating Indices
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first row in a nonempty DataTable. If the DataTable is empty, startIndex is equal to endIndex.
var endIndex: Int
The DataTable’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
