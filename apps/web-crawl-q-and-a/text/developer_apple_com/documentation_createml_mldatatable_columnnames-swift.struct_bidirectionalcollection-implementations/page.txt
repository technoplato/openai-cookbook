Instance Properties
var last: Self.Element?
The last element of the collection.
Instance Methods
func difference<C>(from: C) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, Self.Element) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.
func dropLast(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence containing all but the specified number of final elements.
func firstRange<C>(of: C) -> Range<Self.Index>?
Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given collection within this collection.
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func joined(separator: String) -> String
Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.
Available when Element is String.
func last(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the last element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func lastIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the last index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func lastIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the index of the last element in the collection that matches the given predicate.
func reversed() -> ReversedCollection<Self>
Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.
func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.
