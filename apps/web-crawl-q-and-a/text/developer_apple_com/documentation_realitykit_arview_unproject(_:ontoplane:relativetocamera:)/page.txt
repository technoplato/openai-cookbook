Instance Method
unproject(_:ontoPlane:relativeToCamera:)
Unproject a 2D point from the view onto a plane in 3D world coordinates.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
@MainActor
func unproject(
    _ point: CGPoint,
    ontoPlane planeTransform: float4x4,
    relativeToCamera: Bool
) -> SIMD3<Float>?
Parameters
point
A point in the view’s coordinate system.
planeTransform
The transform used to define the coordinate system of the plane. The coordinate system’s positive Y axis is assumed to be the normal of the plane.
realtiveToCamera
If the plane transform is relative to camera space or world space.
Return Value
3D position in world coordinates or nil if unprojection is not possible.
Discussion
A 2D point in the view’s coordinate space can refer to any point along a line segment in the 3D coordinate space. Unprojecting gets the 3D position of the point along this line segment that intersects the provided plane.
