Structure
BindableValue
The value of a bindable target.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct BindableValue<T> where T : BindableData
Overview
This structure holds the value of an animatable property (animatedValue), that is, the target property that animates. In addition, the structure stores the property’s original value (baseValue), which represents the property’s value before a running animation starts. The value property returns the animated value when an animation runs; when the animation isn’t running, it returns the base value.
Topics
Creating a Value
init(T, animatedValue: T?)
Creates a bindable value.
Accessing the Value
var value: T
The main accessor for the bind value.
var baseValue: T
A value that reflects the state of the animated property before or after an animation.
var animatedValue: T?
A value that represents the state of the animated property as an animation progresses.
