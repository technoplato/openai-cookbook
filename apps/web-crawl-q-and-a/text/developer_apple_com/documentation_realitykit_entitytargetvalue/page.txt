struct EntityTargetValue<Value>
Overview
Spatial data from a location returned by a gesture can be converted to and from the entity using functions defined in RealityCoordinateSpaceConverting.
For example, here’s how to convert location from a DragGesture to the parent of an Entity:
DragGesture(coordinateSpace: .global).targetedToEntity().updating($state) { state, value, _ in
    let location = value.convert(
        value.location, from: .global, to: value.entity.parent
    )
    ...
}
Topics

var entity: Entity

var gestureValue: Value
