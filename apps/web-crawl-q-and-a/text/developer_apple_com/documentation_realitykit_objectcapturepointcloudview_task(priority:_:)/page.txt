func task(
    priority: TaskPriority = .userInitiated,
    _ action: @escaping () async -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
priority
The task priority to use when creating the asynchronous task. The default priority is doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/TaskPriority/3851283-userInitiated.
action
A closure that SwiftUI calls as an asynchronous task before the view appears. SwiftUI will automatically cancel the task at some point after the view disappears before the action completes.
Return Value
A view that runs the specified action asynchronously before the view appears.
Discussion
Use this modifier to perform an asynchronous task with a lifetime that matches that of the modified view. If the task doesn’t finish before SwiftUI removes the view or the view changes identity, SwiftUI cancels the task.
Use the await keyword inside the task to wait for an asynchronous call to complete, or to wait on the values of an AsyncSequence instance. For example, you can modify a Text view to start a task that loads content from a remote resource:
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
@State private var message = "Loading..."


var body: some View {
    Text(message)
        .task {
            do {
                var receivedLines = [String]()
                for try await line in url.lines {
                    receivedLines.append(line)
                    message = "Received \(receivedLines.count) lines"
                }
            } catch {
                message = "Failed to load"
            }
        }
}
This example uses the lines method to get the content stored at the specified URL as an asynchronous sequence of strings. When each new line arrives, the body of the for-await-in loop stores the line in an array of strings and updates the content of the text view to report the latest line count.
