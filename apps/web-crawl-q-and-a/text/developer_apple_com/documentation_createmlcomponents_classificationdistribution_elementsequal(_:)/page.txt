Instance Method
elementsEqual(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.

Mac Catalyst 16.0+

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(_ other: OtherSequence) -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, Self.Element == OtherSequence.Element
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
Return Value
true if this sequence and other contain the same elements in the same order.
Discussion
At least one of the sequences must be finite.
This example tests whether one countable range shares the same elements as another countable range and an array.
let a = 1...3
let b = 1...10


print(a.elementsEqual(b))
// Prints "false"
print(a.elementsEqual([1, 2, 3]))
// Prints "true"
Complexity
O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.
