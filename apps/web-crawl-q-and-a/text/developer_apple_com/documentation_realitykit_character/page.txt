Character control
Direct the movements and animation of character models.
Overview
Games and immersive game-like experiences often rely on animated character models to represent the player or non-player characters. The CharacterControllerComponent simplifies the process of moving a character around a scene. It handles basic movement, including navigating up and down stairs and slopes and jumping. It also allows you to sync the character movement with specific animations.
