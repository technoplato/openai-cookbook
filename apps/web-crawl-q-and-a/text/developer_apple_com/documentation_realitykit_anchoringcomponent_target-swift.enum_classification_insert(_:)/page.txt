Instance Method
insert(_:)
Adds the given element to the option set if it is not already a member.

@discardableResult
mutating func insert(_ newMember: Self.Element) -> (inserted: Bool, memberAfterInsert: Self.Element)
Available when Self is Self.Element.
Parameters
newMember
The element to insert.
Return Value
(true, newMember) if newMember was not contained in self. Otherwise, returns (false, oldMember), where oldMember is the member of the set equal to newMember.
Overview
In the following example, the .secondDay shipping option is added to the freeOptions option set if purchasePrice is greater than 50.0. For the ShippingOptions declaration, see the OptionSet protocol discussion.
let purchasePrice = 87.55


var freeOptions: ShippingOptions = [.standard, .priority]
if purchasePrice > 50 {
    freeOptions.insert(.secondDay)
}
print(freeOptions.contains(.secondDay))
// Prints "true"

func subtracting(Self) -> Self
Returns a new set containing the elements of this set that do not occur in the given set.
func symmetricDifference(Self) -> Self
Returns a new option set with the elements contained in this set or in the given set, but not in both.
func union(Self) -> Self
Returns a new option set of the elements contained in this set, in the given set, or in both.
