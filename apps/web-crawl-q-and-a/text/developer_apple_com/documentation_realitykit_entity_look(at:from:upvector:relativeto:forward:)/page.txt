Instance Method
look(at:from:upVector:relativeTo:forward:)
Positions and orients the entity such that it looks at certain target from a give position.
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func look(
    at target: SIMD3<Float>,
    from position: SIMD3<Float>,
    upVector: SIMD3<Float> = SIMD3<Float>(0, 1, 0),
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?,
    forward: Entity.ForwardDirection = .negativeZ
)
Parameters
target
The target position to look at.
position
The new position of the entity.
upVector
The up direction of the entity.
referenceEntity
The reference entity which defines the frame of reference. Can be nil, which is equivalent to “world space”.
forward
Use default forward (.negativeZ). Can be set to .positiveZ for non-camera entities
Discussion
This function moves the entity to the specified position. It rotates the entity such that the forward direction is pointing towards target. It further makes sure that entity’s up direction aligns with the specified upVector.
Note: This method can be used for non-camera entities.
