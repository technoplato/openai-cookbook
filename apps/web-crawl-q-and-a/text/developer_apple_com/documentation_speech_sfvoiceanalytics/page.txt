Overview
Use an SFAcousticFeature object to access the SFVoiceAnalytics insights. Voice analytics include the following features:
Use jitter to measure how pitch varies in audio.
Use shimmer to measure how amplitude varies in audio.
Use pitch to measure the highness and lowness of the tone.
Use voicing to identify voiced regions in speech.
These results are part of the SFTranscriptionSegment object and are available when the system sends the isFinal flag.
Topics
Analyzing voice
class SFAcousticFeature
The value of a voice analysis metric.
var voicing: SFAcousticFeature
The likelihood of a voice in each frame of a transcription segment.
var pitch: SFAcousticFeature
The highness or lowness of the tone (fundamental frequency) in each frame of a transcription segment, expressed as a logarithm.
var jitter: SFAcousticFeature
The variation in pitch in each frame of a transcription segment, expressed as a percentage of the frame’s fundamental frequency.
var shimmer: SFAcousticFeature
The variation in vocal volume stability (amplitude) in each frame of a transcription segment, expressed in decibels.
