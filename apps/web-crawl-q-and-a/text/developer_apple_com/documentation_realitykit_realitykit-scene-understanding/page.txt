Scene reconstruction and understanding
Detect objects in an AR scene or create a detailed 3D reconstruction of the real world environment.
Overview
RealityKit can detect planes in the real-world environment on any device, allowing you to place virtual objects in the world and have them interact. On devices with a LiDAR sensor, RealityKit can create a detailed reconstruction of the surrounding environment, allowing more precise interactions between virtual content and the real-world. With scene understanding enabled, RealityKit not only reconstructs the environment, but can also recognize what many real world objects are.
To enable scene understanding in an iOS or macOS RealityKit app, insert options into sceneUnderstanding, like this:
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.occlusion)
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.physics)
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.collision)
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.receivesLighting)
To enable sccene understanding for a visionOS app, use a ARKit/SceneReconstructionProvider
let arSession = ARKitSession()
let sceneReconstruction = SceneReconstructionProvider(modes: [])


Task {
    do {
        try await arSession.run([sceneReconstruction])
    } catch {
        // handle error
    }
}
