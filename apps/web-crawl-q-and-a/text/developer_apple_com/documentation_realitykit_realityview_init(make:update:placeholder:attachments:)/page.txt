Note
Attachment views are not automatically added to your RealityView’s content. Instead, you must explicitly add these entities to the hierarchy. Attachment entities can be placed normally or parented to any other entity. Access details of a attachment entity, like its bounds, using methods on the ViewAttachmentEntity type.
