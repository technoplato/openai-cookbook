@MainActor
func look(
    at target: SIMD3<Float>,
    from position: SIMD3<Float>,
    upVector: SIMD3<Float> = SIMD3<Float>(0, 1, 0),
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
target
The target position to look at.
position
The new position of the entity.
upVector
The up direction of the entity after moving.
relativeTo
The entity that defines a frame of reference. Set this to nil to indicate world space.
Discussion
You can use this method on any entity, but it’s particularly useful for orienting cameras and lights to aim at a particular point in space.
