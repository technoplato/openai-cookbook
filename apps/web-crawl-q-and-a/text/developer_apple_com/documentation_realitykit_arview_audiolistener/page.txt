@MainActor
var audioListener: Entity? { get set }
Discussion
Set the audioListener to the entity in the scene from whose point of view RealityKit should render spatial audio.
By default, the property is set to nil, in which case the active camera acts as the audio listener. This is usually what you want, because the camera typically mirrors the user’s point of view.
