Topics
Retrieving Metric Keys
case accuracy
The metric for the model’s accuracy.
case contentLoss
The metric for the style transfer model’s content loss.
case loss
The metric for the model’s loss.
case styleLoss
The metric for the style transfer model’s style loss.
case stylizedImageURL
The location of the stylized image content in the file system.
case validationAccuracy
The metric for the model’s validation accuracy.
case validationLoss
The metric for the model’s validation loss.
Iterating All Metric Keys
static var allCases: [MLProgress.Metric]
A collection of all values of this type.
typealias AllCases
A type that can represent a collection of all values of this type.
Creating a Key from a String
init?(rawValue: String)
Creates a new instance with the specified raw value.
Getting a Key’s String Value
var rawValue: String
The corresponding value of the raw type.
typealias RawValue
The raw type that can be used to represent all values of the conforming type.
Encoding and Decoding a Key
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder, when the type’s RawValue is String.
Available when Self conforms to Encodable and RawValue is String.
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder, when the type’s RawValue is String.
Available when Self conforms to Decodable and RawValue is String.
Providing a Key’s Hash Value
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Available when Self conforms to Hashable and RawValue conforms to Hashable.
var hashValue: Int
Available when Self conforms to Hashable and RawValue conforms to Hashable.
Comparing Metric Keys
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Enumeration Cases
case maximumError
The metric for the model’s maximum error.

case rootMeanSquaredError
The metric for the model’s root mean squared error (RMSE).
Beta
case validationMaximumError
The metric for the model’s validation maximum error.
Beta
case validationRootMeanSquaredError
The metric for the model’s validation root mean squared error (RMSE).
