RealityKit
SwiftUI
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    named name: String,
    bundle: Bundle? = nil
) where Content == ResolvedModel3D
Parameters
name
The name of the USD or Reality file to display.
bundle
The Bundle used to look up the model by name. If not provided, defaults to the app’s main bundle.
Discussion
Until the model loads, Model3D displays a default placeholder. When the load operation completes successfully, Model3D updates the view to show the loaded model. If the operation fails, Model3D continues to display the placeholder. The following example loads and displays a model from an example server:
Model3D(named: "Robot-Drummer")
If you want to customize the placeholder or apply ResolvedModel3D-specific modifiers — like ResolvedModel3D/resizable() — to the loaded model, use the init(named:bundle:content:placeholder:) initializer instead.
