class VNFaceLandmarks2D : VNFaceLandmarks
Overview
This class represents the set of all detectable 2D face landmarks and regions, exposed as properties. The coordinates of the face landmarks are normalized to the dimensions of the face observation’s boundingBox, with the origin at the bounding box’s lower-left corner. Use the VNImagePointForFaceLandmarkPoint(_:_:_:_:) function to convert normalized face landmark points into absolute points within the image’s coordinate system.
Topics
Face Landmark Points
var allPoints: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing all face landmark points.
var faceContour: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that trace the face contour from the left cheek, over the chin, to the right cheek.
var leftEye: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that outline the left eye.
var rightEye: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that outline the right eye.
var leftEyebrow: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that trace the left eyebrow.
var rightEyebrow: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that trace the right eyebrow.
var nose: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that outline the nose.
var noseCrest: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that trace the center crest of the nose.
var medianLine: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that trace a vertical line down the center of the face.
var outerLips: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that outline the outside of the lips.
var innerLips: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing points that outline the space between the lips.
var leftPupil: VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D?
The region containing the point where the left pupil is located.
