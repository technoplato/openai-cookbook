static func ... (maximum: Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>
Parameters
maximum
The upper bound for the range.
Discussion
Use the prefix closed range operator (prefix ...) to create a partial range of any type that conforms to the Comparable protocol. This example creates a PartialRangeThrough<Double> instance that includes any value less than or equal to 5.0.
let throughFive = ...5.0


throughFive.contains(4.0)     // true
throughFive.contains(5.0)     // true
throughFive.contains(6.0)     // false
You can use this type of partial range of a collection’s indices to represent the range from the start of the collection up to, and including, the partial range’s upper bound.
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
print(numbers[...3])
// Prints "[10, 20, 30, 40]"
Precondition
maximum must compare equal to itself (i.e. cannot be NaN).
