func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Return Value
A random element from the collection. If the collection is empty, the method returns nil.
Overview
Call randomElement() to select a random element from an array or another collection. This example picks a name at random from an array:
let names = ["Zoey", "Chloe", "Amani", "Amaia"]
let randomName = names.randomElement()!
// randomName == "Amani"
This method is equivalent to calling randomElement(using:), passing in the system’s default random generator.
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
var first: Self.Element?
The first element of the collection.
func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func randomElement<T>(using: inout T) -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
