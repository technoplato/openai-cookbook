Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
var outputTextureMaps: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification.TextureMapOutputs
Discussion
This setting can reduce model size by only requesting maps that will be used on the target renderer. Example to get just color and normal maps:
var detailSpec = PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Detail.Specification()
detailSpec.outputTextureMaps = [.diffuseColor, .normal]
