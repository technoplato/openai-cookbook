Initializer
init(matrix:)
Creates a new transform represented as a 4x4 matrix.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(matrix: float4x4)
Parameters
matrix
A transformation matrix.
Discussion
A Transform component can’t represent every transform that a general 4x4 matrix can . Using a 4x4 matrix during initialization might result in certain transformations, such as shear, being lost.
