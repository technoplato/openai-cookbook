Instance Method
difference(from:)
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
SwiftData
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func difference<C>(from other: C) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element> where C : BidirectionalCollection, Self.Element == C.Element
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
other
The base state.
Return Value
The difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
Discussion
This function does not infer element moves. If you need to infer moves, call the inferringMoves() method on the resulting difference.
Complexity
Worst case performance is O(n * m), where n is the count of this collection and m is other.count. You can expect faster execution when the collections share many common elements, or if Element conforms to Hashable.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
