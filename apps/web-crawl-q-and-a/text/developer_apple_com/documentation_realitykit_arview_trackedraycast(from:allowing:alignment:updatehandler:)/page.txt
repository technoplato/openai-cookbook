Instance Method
trackedRaycast(from:allowing:alignment:updateHandler:)
Performs a tracked ray cast, where a ray is cast into the scene from the center of the camera through a point in the view.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
@MainActor
func trackedRaycast(
    from point: CGPoint,
    allowing target: ARRaycastQuery.Target,
    alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment,
    updateHandler: @escaping ([ARRaycastResult]) -> Void
) -> ARTrackedRaycast?
Parameters
point
A point in the view’s local coordinate system.
target
The type of target where the ray should terminate.
alignment
The alignment of the target.
Return Value
A tracked ray-cast instance used to update or stop ray casting. The result is nil if the ray cast fails or if the AR session configuration isn’t ARWorldTrackingConfiguration or one of its subclasses.
Discussion
updateHandler: A closure the method calls to update the list of results, sorted from nearest to farthest from the camera. The closure is called on the session instance’s delegate queue.

func hitTest(CGPoint, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Searches for objects corresponding to a point in the view based on a query and a collision mask.
func hitTest(CGPoint, types: ARHitTestResult.ResultType) -> [ARHitTestResult]
Searches for objects corresponding to a point in the view based on a set of result types.
func makeRaycastQuery(from: CGPoint, allowing: ARRaycastQuery.Target, alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment) -> ARRaycastQuery?
Creates a ray-cast query originating from a point in the view, centered on the camera’s field of view.
func raycast(from: CGPoint, allowing: ARRaycastQuery.Target, alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment) -> [ARRaycastResult]
Performs a ray cast, where a ray is cast into the scene from the center of the camera through a point in the view, and the results are immediately returned.
