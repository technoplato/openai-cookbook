func sink(
    receiveCompletion: @escaping ((Subscribers.Completion<Self.Failure>) -> Void),
    receiveValue: @escaping ((Self.Output) -> Void)
) -> AnyCancellable
Parameters
receiveComplete
The closure to execute on completion.
receiveValue
The closure to execute on receipt of a value.
Return Value
A cancellable instance, which you use when you end assignment of the received value. Deallocation of the result will tear down the subscription stream.
Discussion
Use sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) to observe values received by the publisher and process them using a closure you specify.
In this example, a Range publisher publishes integers to a sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) operator’s receiveValue closure that prints them to the console. Upon completion the sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:) operator’s receiveCompletion closure indicates the successful termination of the stream.
let myRange = (0...3)
cancellable = myRange.publisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },
          receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0)") })


// Prints:
//  value: 0
//  value: 1
//  value: 2
//  value: 3
//  completion: finished
This method creates the subscriber and immediately requests an unlimited number of values, prior to returning the subscriber. The return value should be held, otherwise the stream will be canceled.
