Discussion
Call this method to change the transform applied to a body by physics simulation. This only matters for dynamic rigid bodies, with a mode of PhysicsBodyMode.dynamic. This is the only kind of body that’s affected by physics simulations. For all others, modify the entity’s transform property directly.
Conversely, directly modifying the transform of a dynamic body has no effect because the physics simulation overwrites it on every frame.
transform: The new transform to inject into the dynamic physics simulation of the entity.
recursive: Apply the reset to child entities.
