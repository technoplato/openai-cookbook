Transforms: Position, Orientation, and Scale
Control the placement of virtual objects.
Overview
In a 3D environment, you control the location, rotation, and size of an Entity by changing values on its Transform component. Changing the translation, moves the object to a different location. In some contexts, translation is also referred to as position or location. Changing the scale value makes the entity bigger or smaller while changing its rotation points the entity in a different direction. Rotation is sometimes also referred to as orientation.
Topics
