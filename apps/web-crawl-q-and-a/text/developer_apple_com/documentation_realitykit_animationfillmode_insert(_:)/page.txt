@discardableResult
mutating func insert(_ newMember: Self.Element) -> (inserted: Bool, memberAfterInsert: Self.Element)
Available when Self is Self.Element.
Parameters
newMember
The element to insert.
Return Value
(true, newMember) if the option set doesn’t already contain newMember. Otherwise, returns (false, oldMember), where oldMember is the member of the set equal to newMember.
