Discussion
Hidden views are invisible and can’t receive or respond to interactions. However, they do remain in the view hierarchy and affect layout. Use this modifier if you want to include a view for layout purposes, but don’t want it to display.
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "a.circle.fill")
    Image(systemName: "b.circle.fill")
    Image(systemName: "c.circle.fill")
        .hidden()
    Image(systemName: "d.circle.fill")
}
The third circle takes up space, because it’s still present, but SwiftUI doesn’t draw it onscreen.
If you want to conditionally include a view in the view hierarchy, use an if statement instead:
VStack {
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "a.circle.fill")
        Image(systemName: "b.circle.fill")
        if !isHidden {
            Image(systemName: "c.circle.fill")
        }
        Image(systemName: "d.circle.fill")
    }
    Toggle("Hide", isOn: $isHidden)
}
Depending on the current value of the isHidden state variable in the example above, controlled by the Toggle instance, SwiftUI draws the circle or completely omits it from the layout.
