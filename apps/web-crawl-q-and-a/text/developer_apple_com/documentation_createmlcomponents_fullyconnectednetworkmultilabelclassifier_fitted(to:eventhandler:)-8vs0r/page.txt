func fitted<Input>(
    to input: Input,
    eventHandler: EventHandler? = nil
) async throws -> FullyConnectedNetworkMultiLabelClassifierModel<Scalar, Label> where Input : Sequence, Input.Element == AnnotatedFeature<MLShapedArray<Scalar>, Set<Label>>
Parameters
input
A sequence of examples used for fitting the classifier.
eventHandler
An event handler.
Return Value
The fitted fully-connected network multi-label classifier model.
Discussion
The training process partitions the input into random batches according to the batch size configuration parameter. Training stops when the maximum number of iterations is reached.
Note
This method does not do early-stopping, using a high value for maximumIterations may lead to over-fitting. Consider providing a validation set.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
