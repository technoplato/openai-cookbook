func scrollBounceBehavior(
    _ behavior: ScrollBounceBehavior,
    axes: Axis.Set = [.vertical]
) -> some View
Parameters
behavior
The bounce behavior to apply to any scrollable views within the configured view. Use one of the ScrollBounceBehavior values.
axes
The set of axes to apply behavior to. The default is Axis/vertical.
Return Value
A view that’s configured with the specified scroll bounce behavior.
Discussion
Use this modifier to indicate whether scrollable views bounce when people scroll to the end of the view’s content, taking into account the relative sizes of the view and its content. For example, the following ScrollView only enables bounce behavior if its content is large enough to require scrolling:
ScrollView {
    Text("Small")
    Text("Content")
}
.scrollBounceBehavior(.basedOnSize)
The modifier passes the scroll bounce mode through the Environment, which means that the mode affects any scrollable views in the modified view hierarchy. Provide an axis to the modifier to constrain the kinds of scrollable views that the mode affects. For example, all the scroll views in the following example can access the mode value, but only the two nested scroll views are affected, because only they use horizontal scrolling:
ScrollView { // Defaults to vertical scrolling.
    ScrollView(.horizontal) {
        ShelfContent()
    }
    ScrollView(.horizontal) {
        ShelfContent()
    }
}
.scrollBounceBehavior(.basedOnSize, axes: .horizontal)
You can use this modifier to configure any kind of scrollable view, including ScrollView, List, Table, and TextEditor:
List {
    Text("Hello")
    Text("World")
}
.scrollBounceBehavior(.basedOnSize)
