Instance Property
trimDuration
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var trimDuration: TimeInterval? { get set }
Discussion
The framework calculates duration, but you can set this property to override it. This property is nil by default, which indicates that the animation stops after one play that spans duration.
If you set a value for this property and both trimStart and trimEnd are nil, the animation observes this property as an edited duration.
A value greater than duration causes the animation to repeat, applying the characteristics defined by repeatMode. Assign this property doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/double/1849607-greatestfinitemagnitude to repeat indefinitely.
