    _ keyPath1: KeyPath<Self.Output, T1>,
    _ keyPath2: KeyPath<Self.Output, T2>
) -> Publishers.MapKeyPath3<Self, T0, T1, T2>
Parameters
keyPath0
The key path of a property on Output.
keyPath1
The key path of a second property on Output.
keyPath2
The key path of a third property on Output.
Return Value
A publisher that publishes the values of three key paths as a tuple.
Discussion
In the following example, the map(_:_:_:) operator uses the Swift key path syntax to access the die1, die2, and die3 members of the DiceRoll structure published by the Just publisher.
The downstream sink subscriber receives only these three values (as an (Int, Int, Int) tuple), not the entire DiceRoll.
struct DiceRoll {
    let die1: Int
    let die2: Int
    let die3: Int
}


cancellable = Just(DiceRoll(die1:Int.random(in:1...6),
                            die2: Int.random(in:1...6),
                            die3: Int.random(in:1...6)))
    .map(\.die1, \.die2, \.die3)
    .sink { values in
        print ("Rolled: \(values.0), \(values.1), \(values.2) (total \(values.0 + values.1 + values.2))")
    }
// Prints "Rolled: 5, 4, 2 (total 11)" (or other random values).
