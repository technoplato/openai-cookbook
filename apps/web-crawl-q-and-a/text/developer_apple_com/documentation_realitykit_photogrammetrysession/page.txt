Class
PhotogrammetrySession
PhotogrammetrySession controls the reconstruction process of a set of images of an object into a 3D model.

class PhotogrammetrySession
Topics
Creating the Session
init(input: URL, configuration: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration) throws
Creates a session that will use all images found in the given input directory URL as samples for reconstruction.
init<S>(input: S, configuration: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration) throws
Creates a session that takes a custom sequence of input PhotogrammetrySample objects by iterating the passed in Sequence object lazily.
static var isSupported: Bool
Returns true if the current hardware supports Object Capture.
Configuring the Session
var configuration: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration
Readonly property containing the session configuration set in the construction.
struct Configuration
The configuration parameters for a photogrammetry session.
Monitoring the Session
var activeRequests: [PhotogrammetrySession.Request]
The session’s active request objects.
var isProcessing: Bool
The session is actively processing requests.
var outputs: PhotogrammetrySession.Outputs
Returns the outputs message stream which can be asynchronously iterated on.
enum Output
Status updates on the object-creation process.
Controlling Object Creation
func process(requests: [PhotogrammetrySession.Request]) throws
Starts processing of the provided processing requests. Messages begin to be produced to the output publisher.
func cancel()
Requests cancellation of any running requests.
Creating Requests
enum Request
An object that configures a photogrammetry session reconstruction request.
Obtaining Results
enum Result
An object that holds the created 3D object.
struct PointCloud
A sparse point cloud data structure output as the payload of a .pointCloud request. A point cloud is an array of PointCloud.Point instances.
Structures
struct Limits
Data structure to observe hardware limits for reconstruction. Note that these are specific to the device on which the PhotogrammetrySession is run.
Beta
struct Pose
A 6DOF pose relative to the estimated coordinate system.
Beta
struct Poses
Once initial photogrammetric calculations are complete, a data structure mapping the sample ID (or index if a folder was used) to the 6DOF algorithmically estimated pose of that sample is returned.
Beta
Type Properties
static let limits: PhotogrammetrySession.Limits
Observer for the device-specific constant hardware limits for reconstruction.
Beta
Enumerations
enum Error
An error type thrown from various functions if problems in reconstruction are encountered. These should be localized by the app.
