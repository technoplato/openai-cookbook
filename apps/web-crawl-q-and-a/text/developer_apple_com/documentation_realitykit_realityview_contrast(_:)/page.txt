func contrast(_ amount: Double) -> some View
Parameters
amount
The intensity of color contrast to apply. negative values invert colors in addition to applying contrast.
Return Value
A view that applies color contrast to this view.
Discussion
Apply contrast to a view to increase or decrease the separation between similar colors in the view.
In the example below, the contrast(_:) modifier is applied to a set of red squares each containing a contrasting green inner circle. At each step in the loop, the contrast(_:) modifier changes the contrast of the circle/square view in 20% increments. This ranges from -20% contrast (yielding inverted colors — turning the red square to pale-green and the green circle to mauve), to neutral-gray at 0%, to 100% contrast (bright-red square / bright-green circle). Applying negative contrast values, as shown in the -20% square, will apply contrast in addition to inverting colors.
struct CircleView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(Color.green)
            .frame(width: 25, height: 25, alignment: .center)
    }
}


struct Contrast: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(-1..<6) {
                Color.red.frame(width: 50, height: 50, alignment: .center)
                    .overlay(CircleView(), alignment: .center)
                    .contrast(Double($0) * 0.2)
                    .overlay(Text("\(Double($0) * 0.2 * 100, specifier: "%.0f")%")
                                 .font(.callout),
                             alignment: .bottom)
                    .border(Color.gray)
            }
        }
    }
}
