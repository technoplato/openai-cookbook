struct AnimationView
Overview
This structure creates a variation of an existing animation by overriding its configuration. The term view in the name signifies that the variation represents a new visual perspective of the existing animation.
Create a Clip of an Animation
By supplying a new beginning time (trimStart) and ending time (trimEnd), the following code creates a shorter clip of an existing animation. With trimStart set to 1.0 and trimEnd at 2.0, the clip spans a one-second duration.
// Create or access an existing animation.
let anim1 = FromToByAnimation<Float>(name: "Anim1",
    from: 100.0, to: 200.0, duration: 10.0)


// Use a view to create a clip of the original animation.
let view = AnimationView(source: anim1,
    name: "clip",
    bindTarget: nil,
    blendLayer: 0,
    repeatMode: .autoReverse,
    fillMode: [],
    trimStart: 1.0,
    trimEnd: 2.0,
    trimDuration: nil,
    offset: 0,
    delay: 0,
    speed: 1.0)


// Create an animation resource from the clip.
clipResource = try? AnimationResource.generate(with: view)


// Play the clip.
myModelEntity.playAnimation(clipResource)
Define a View in Relation to the Animation Source
The source animation’s timing properties define a timeline on which the trimDuration, delay, and speed properties operate to derive the view. The trimDuration property specifies which animation data the view displays. If trimDuration exceeds the length of the source animation’s timeline, the animation plays according to the characteristics of repeatMode. The delay property defines a waiting period before the animation begins, and the speed determines how fast the view plays in relation to the original pace.
Topics
Creating an Animation View
init(source: AnimationDefinition, name: String, bindTarget: BindTarget?, blendLayer: Int32, repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode, fillMode: AnimationFillMode, trimStart: TimeInterval?, trimEnd: TimeInterval?, trimDuration: TimeInterval?, offset: TimeInterval, delay: TimeInterval, speed: Float)
Creates a variation of the given animation by overriding its properties.
Configuring the Animation View
var source: (AnimationDefinition)?
The original animation that this structure modifies.
var name: String
A textual name for the animation.
var bindTarget: BindTarget
A textual name that identifies the animated property.
var blendLayer: Int32
The order in which the framework composites the animation.
Timing the Animation
var speed: Float
A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
var delay: TimeInterval
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
var duration: TimeInterval
The total playback time of the animation.
var offset: TimeInterval
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
var trimDuration: TimeInterval?
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
var trimStart: TimeInterval?
The time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.
var trimEnd: TimeInterval?
The time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.
func trimmed(start: TimeInterval?, end: TimeInterval?, duration: TimeInterval?) -> Self
Edits the animation duration according to the specified time.
Repeating Animation Playback
var repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
var fillMode: AnimationFillMode
An option that determines which data displays outside of the normal duration.
func repeated(count: TimeInterval) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by an irrational number.
func repeated(count: Int) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by a whole number.
func repeatingForever() -> Self
Repeats the animation infinitely.
