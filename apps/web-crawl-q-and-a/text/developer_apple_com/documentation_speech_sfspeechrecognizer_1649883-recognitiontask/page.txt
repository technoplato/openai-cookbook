func recognitionTask(
    with request: SFSpeechRecognitionRequest,
    resultHandler: @escaping (SFSpeechRecognitionResult?, Error?) -> Void
) -> SFSpeechRecognitionTask
Parameters
request
A request (in an SFSpeechRecognitionRequest object) to recognize speech from an audio source.
resultHandler
The block to call when partial or final results are available, or when an error occurs. If the shouldReportPartialResults property is true, this block may be called multiple times to deliver the partial and final results. The block has no return value and takes the following parameters:
result
A SFSpeechRecognitionResult containing the partial or final transcriptions of the audio content.
error
An error object if a problem occurred. This parameter is nil if speech recognition was successful.
Return Value
The task object you can use to manage an in-progress recognition request.
Discussion
Use this method to initiate the speech recognition process on the audio contained in the request object. This method executes asynchronously and returns a SFSpeechRecognitionTask object that you can use to cancel or finalize the recognition process later. As results become available, the method calls the block in the resultHandler parameter.
