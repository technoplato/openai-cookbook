func canPrevent(UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
func location(in: Entity?) -> SIMD3<Float>?
Returns the unprojected location of the gesture represented by the receiver in the space of the given entity.
func reset()
Overridden to reset internal state when a gesture recognition attempt completes.
func touchesBegan(Set<UITouch>, with: UIEvent)
