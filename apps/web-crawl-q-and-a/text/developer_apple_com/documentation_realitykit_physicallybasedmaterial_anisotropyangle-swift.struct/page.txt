Topics
Creating an Anisotropy Angle Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an anisotropy angle object from a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates an anisotropy angle object using a single value or a texture.
Accessing Anisotropy Angle Values
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The anisotropy angle values specified using a UV-mapped image.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of this object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The anistropy angle specified as a single value.
typealias FloatLiteralType
The type of scalar parameter used by this parameter.
