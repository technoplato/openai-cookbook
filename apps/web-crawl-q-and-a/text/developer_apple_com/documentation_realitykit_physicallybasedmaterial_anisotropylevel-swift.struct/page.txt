PhysicallyBasedMaterial.AnisotropyLevel
An object that defines the degree to which an entity reflects light to create stretched or oblong highlights.

struct AnisotropyLevel
Overview
By default, PBR materials are isotropic; in other words, an entity that uses PhysicallyBasedMaterial reflects light uniformly in all directions, mimicking the behavior of most real-world objects. Some objects, including those with many small parallel striations such as vinyl records, CDs, or straight hair, reflect light more in some directions than others, resulting in stretched or oblong specular highlights, as shown in the following figure.
Use this object to specify the anisotropyLevel for a material.
Topics
Creating an Anisotropy Level Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an anisotropy level object from a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates an anisotropy level object using a single value or a texture.
Accessing Anisotropy Level Values
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The anisotropy level values specified using a UV-mapped image.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of this object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The anistropy level specified as a single value.
typealias FloatLiteralType
The type of scalar value this parameter uses.
