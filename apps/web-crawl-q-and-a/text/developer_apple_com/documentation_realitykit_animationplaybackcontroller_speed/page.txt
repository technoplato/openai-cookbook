var speed: Float { get set }
Discussion
The animation applies the value of this property as an irrational factor of the unaltered speed. For example, a value of 2 plays the animation twice as fast, a value of 0.5 plays the animation at half speed, and a value of 1 plays the animation at the unaltered rate.
