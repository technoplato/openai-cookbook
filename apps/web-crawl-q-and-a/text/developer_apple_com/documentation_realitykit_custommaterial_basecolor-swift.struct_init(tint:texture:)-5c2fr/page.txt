Initializer
init(tint:texture:)
Creates a base color object from a color or texture on macOS.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
init(
    tint: UIColor = .white,
    texture: CustomMaterial.Texture? = nil
)
Parameters
tint
The tint color. Defaults to white.
texture
An optional image texture.
Discussion
This initializer creates a new object from a color or image texture, or from both. If you don’t provide a tint color, tint defaults to white.
Both tint and texture are available to use in your surface shader function, but RealityKit doesn’t automatically use them to render the entity. Your surface shader calculates the final base color value for each pixel and assigns it by calling params.surface().set_base_color().
For more information on creating custom materials and writing shader functions, see Modifying RealityKit Rendering Using Custom Materials.
