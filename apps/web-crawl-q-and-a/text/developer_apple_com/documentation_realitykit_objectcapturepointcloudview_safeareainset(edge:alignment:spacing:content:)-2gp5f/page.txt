func safeAreaInset<V>(
    edge: VerticalEdge,
    alignment: HorizontalAlignment = .center,
    spacing: CGFloat? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> V
) -> some View where V : View
Parameters
edge
The vertical edge of the view to inset by the height of content, to make space for content.
spacing
Extra distance placed between the two views, or nil to use the default amount of spacing.
alignment
The alignment guide used to position content horizontally.
content
A view builder function providing the view to display in the inset space of the modified view.
Return Value
A new view that displays both content above or below the modified view, making space for the content view by vertically insetting the modified view, adjusting the safe area of the result to match.
Discussion
The content view is anchored to the specified vertical edge in the parent view, aligning its horizontal axis to the specified alignment guide. The modified view is inset by the height of content, from edge, with its safe area increased by the same amount.
