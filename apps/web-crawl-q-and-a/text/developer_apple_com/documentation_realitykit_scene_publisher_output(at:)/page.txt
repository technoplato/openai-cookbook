func output(at index: Int) -> Publishers.Output<Self>
Parameters
index
The index that indicates the element to publish.
Return Value
A publisher that publishes a specific indexed element.
Discussion
Use output(at:) when you need to republish a specific element specified by its position in the stream. If the publisher completes normally or with an error before publishing the specified element, then the publisher doesn’t produce any elements.
In the example below, the array publisher emits the fifth element in the sequence of published elements:
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers.publisher
    .output(at: 5)
    .sink { print("\($0)") }


// Prints: "6"
