func cornerRadius(
    _ radius: CGFloat,
    antialiased: Bool = true
) -> some View
Parameters
antialiased
A Boolean value that indicates whether the rendering system applies smoothing to the edges of the clipping rectangle.
Return Value
A view that clips this view to its bounding frame with the specified corner radius.
Discussion
By default, a view’s bounding frame only affects its layout, so any content that extends beyond the edges of the frame remains visible. Use cornerRadius(_:antialiased:) to hide any content that extends beyond these edges while applying a corner radius.
The following code applies a corner radius of 25 to a text view:
Text("Rounded Corners")
    .frame(width: 175, height: 75)
    .foregroundColor(Color.white)
    .background(Color.black)
    .cornerRadius(25)
