var hashValue: Int { get }
Discussion
Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different executions of your program. Do not save hash values to use during a future execution.
Important
hashValue is deprecated as a Hashable requirement. To conform to Hashable, implement the hash(into:) requirement instead. The compiler provides an implementation for hashValue for you.
