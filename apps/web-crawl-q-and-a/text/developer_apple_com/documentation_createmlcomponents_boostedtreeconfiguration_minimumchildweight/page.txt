The minimum weight of each leaf node.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var minimumChildWeight: Double
Discussion
Larger values result in more conservative tree learning and help prevent overfitting. If the tree learning algorithm results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weights less than this value, tree building will terminate. Defaults to 0.1
