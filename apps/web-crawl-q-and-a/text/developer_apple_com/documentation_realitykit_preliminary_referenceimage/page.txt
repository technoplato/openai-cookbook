Preliminary_ReferenceImage
A schema that defines the properties of an image in the physical environment.
Overview
This schema defines the criteria that the runtime uses to recognize an image in the physical environment, including pixel data and width.
When RealityKit opens a USDZ file that defines a reference image, it instantiates an AnchorEntity with a component type doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/realitykit/anchoringcomponent/target/image_group_name.
Declaration
class Preliminary_ReferenceImage "Preliminary_ReferenceImage" (
    inherits = </Typed>
)
Define a Reference Image
The following example defines a prim named ImageReference that instructs the runtime to scan for an image described by image.png.
def Preliminary_ReferenceImage "ImageReference"
{
    uniform asset image = @image.png@
    uniform double physicalWidth = 12
}
