Initializer
init(floatLiteral:)
Creates an object from a single value.

init(floatLiteral value: Float)
Parameters
value
The reflectiveness value for the material.
Discussion
In physically based rendering, the metallic property represents the reflectiveness of an entity. This initializer creates a new object that passes a single metallic value to your custom shader functions but doesn’t pass a texture.
The following Swift code shows how to specify reflectiveness using a single value for the entire entity:
material.roughness = PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Roughness(floatLiteral: 0.0)
To render an entity with reflectiveness, lightingModel must be CustomMaterial.LightingModel.lit or CustomMaterial.LightingModel.clearcoat and its surface shader function must call params.surface().set_metallic().
The following Metal code shows how to retrieve the value set in this initializer in your surface shader and use it:
    // Retrieve the metallic scale from the CustomMaterial.
    float metallic = params.material_constants().metallic_scale();


    // Set the roughness value using the metallic scale value.
    params.surface().set_metallic(metallic);
For more information on creating custom materials and writing shader functions, see Modifying RealityKit Rendering Using Custom Materials.
