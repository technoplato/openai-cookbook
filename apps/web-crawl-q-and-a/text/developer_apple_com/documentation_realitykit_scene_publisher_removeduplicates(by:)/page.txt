func removeDuplicates(by predicate: @escaping (Self.Output, Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Parameters
predicate
A closure to evaluate whether two elements are equivalent, for purposes of filtering. Return true from this closure to indicate that the second element is a duplicate of the first.
Return Value
A publisher that consumes — rather than publishes — duplicate elements.
Discussion
Use removeDuplicates(by:) to remove repeating elements from an upstream publisher based upon the evaluation of the current and previously published elements using a closure you provide.
Use the removeDuplicates(by:) operator when comparing types that don’t themselves implement Equatable, or if you need to compare values differently than the type’s Equatable implementation.
In the example below, the removeDuplicates(by:) functionality triggers when the x property of the current and previous elements are equal, otherwise the operator publishes the current Point to the downstream subscriber:
struct Point {
    let x: Int
    let y: Int
}


let points = [Point(x: 0, y: 0), Point(x: 0, y: 1),
              Point(x: 1, y: 1), Point(x: 2, y: 1)]
cancellable = points.publisher
    .removeDuplicates { prev, current in
        // Considers points to be duplicate if the x coordinate
        // is equal, and ignores the y coordinate
        prev.x == current.x
    }
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


// Prints: Point(x: 0, y: 0) Point(x: 1, y: 1) Point(x: 2, y: 1)

Filtering Elements
func filter((Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.Filter<Self>
Republishes all elements that match a provided closure.
func tryFilter((Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryFilter<Self>
Republishes all elements that match a provided error-throwing closure.
func compactMap<T>((Self.Output) -> T?) -> Publishers.CompactMap<Self, T>
Calls a closure with each received element and publishes any returned optional that has a value.
func tryCompactMap<T>((Self.Output) throws -> T?) -> Publishers.TryCompactMap<Self, T>
Calls an error-throwing closure with each received element and publishes any returned optional that has a value.
func removeDuplicates() -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element.
Available when Output conforms to Equatable.
func tryRemoveDuplicates(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryRemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element, as evaluated by a provided error-throwing closure.
func replaceEmpty(with: Self.Output) -> Publishers.ReplaceEmpty<Self>
Replaces an empty stream with the provided element.
func replaceError(with: Self.Output) -> Publishers.ReplaceError<Self>
Replaces any errors in the stream with the provided element.
