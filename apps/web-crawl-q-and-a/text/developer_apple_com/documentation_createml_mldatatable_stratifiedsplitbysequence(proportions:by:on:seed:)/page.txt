func stratifiedSplitBySequence(
    proportions: [Double],
    by sequenceIdentifierColumn: String,
    on column: String,
    seed: Int = timestampSeed()
) throws -> MLDataTable
Parameters
proportions
An array of values on [0,1] specifying the proprtions in each partition. Automatically normalized to 1.
sequenceIdentifierColumn
The sequence identifier column in an MLDataTable to identify rows of a sequence.
column
The column in an MLDataTable being stratified on.
seed
Seed for the random number generator used for splitting. The default seed is the current epoch time in milliseconds.
Return Value
A new MLDataTable with an additional partition column with the index of the partition for each row.
Discussion
The proportions specified will be applied uniformly to each label being partitioned on.
