struct ParticleEmitterComponent
Topics
Structures
struct ParticleEmitter
struct Presets
Initial configurations that can be set when starting a new simulation.
Initializers
init()
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
var birthDirection: ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthDirection
The possible initial directions for newly spawned particles, relative to the emitter shape.Defaults to normal.
var birthLocation: ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthLocation
The possible locations for newly spawned particles, relative to the emitter shape. Defaults to surface.
var burstCount: Int
Number of particles to emit in a single burst. Defaults to 100.
var burstCountVariation: Int
Defines a plus/minus range from which a value is randomly selected to offset burstCount.
var emissionDirection: SIMD3<Float>
The direction particles are emitted when birthDirection is set to World or Local. Defaults to (0.0, 1.0, 0.0).
var emitterShape: ParticleEmitterComponent.EmitterShape
The shape of the region of space where the system spawns new particles. Defaults to plane.
var emitterShapeSize: SIMD3<Float>
The emitter shape size in meters.
var isEmitting: Bool
Disables/enables particle emission, independent of simulationState. Existing particles will not be affected.
var mainEmitter: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter
Particle attributes affecting the main particles of the base simulation.
var radialAmount: Float
Radial sweep angle for sphere, cylinder, cone, and torus emitter shapes. Defaults to 2 * pi.
var simulationSpace: ParticleEmitterComponent.SimulationSpace
Particle Simulation Space, either local or global
var simulationState: ParticleEmitterComponent.SimulationState
Controls particle simulation state: playing, paused or stopped. Defaults to play.
var spawnInheritsParentColor: Bool
Whether or not the spawnedEmitter’s color should be overriden by the mainEmitter’s color at the time of the spawning.
var spawnOccasion: ParticleEmitterComponent.SpawnOccasion
Determines when main particles emit spawn particles. Defaults to onDeath.
var spawnSpreadFactor: Float
Amount a spawned particle spreads away from its parent particle, works in conjunction with the spawn particle’s spreadingAngle. Defaults to 0.
var spawnSpreadFactorVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range from which a value is randomly selected to offset Spawn Spread Factor.
var spawnVelocityFactor: Float
How much of the parent particle’s velocity to inherit. Defaults to 1.
var spawnedEmitter: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter?
Attributes affecting secondary particles spawned from the main simulation.
var speed: Float
The initial speed, in meters per second, for newly spawned particles. Defaults to 0.5.
var speedVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range (in meters per second) from which a value is randomly selected to offset particle speed.
var timing: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing
Defines the Emitter timing method.
var torusInnerRadius: Float
Radius of the torus’ emitter shape tube. Defaults to 0.25.
Instance Methods
func burst()
Emits burstCount particles on the next update call.
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func restart()
Restarts the emission of particles (non-looping emitter only).
