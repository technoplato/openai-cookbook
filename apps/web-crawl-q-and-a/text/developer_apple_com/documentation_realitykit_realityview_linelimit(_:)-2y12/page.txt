func lineLimit(_ limit: ClosedRange<Int>) -> some View
Parameters
limit
The line limit.
Discussion
Use this modifier to specify a closed range of lines that a Text view or a vertical TextField can occupy. When the text of such views occupies more space than the provided limit, a Text view truncates its content while a TextField becomes scrollable.
Form {
    TextField("Title", text: $model.title)
    TextField("Notes", text: $model.notes, axis: .vertical)
        .lineLimit(1...3)
}
