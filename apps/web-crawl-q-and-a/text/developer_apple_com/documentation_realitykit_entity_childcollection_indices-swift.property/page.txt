Instance Property
indices
The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.

var indices: DefaultIndices<Self> { get }
Available when Indices is DefaultIndices<Self>.
Overview
A collection’s indices property can hold a strong reference to the collection itself, causing the collection to be non-uniquely referenced. If you mutate the collection while iterating over its indices, a strong reference can cause an unexpected copy of the collection. To avoid the unexpected copy, use the index(after:) method starting with startIndex to produce indices instead.
var c = MyFancyCollection([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
var i = c.startIndex
while i != c.endIndex {
    c[i] /= 5
    i = c.index(after: i)
}
// c == MyFancyCollection([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

Manipulating Indices
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection. (See Collection.startIndex.)
var endIndex: Int
TThe collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument. (See Collection.endIndex.)
func firstIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the position immediately after the given index. (See Collection.index.)
func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
