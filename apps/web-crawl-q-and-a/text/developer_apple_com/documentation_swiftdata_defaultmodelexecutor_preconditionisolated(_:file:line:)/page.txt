Discussion
This function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:
In playgrounds and -Onone builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing message.
In -O builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), stops program execution.
In -Ounchecked builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming error.
