var values: AsyncPublisher<Self> { get }
Available when Failure is Never.
Discussion
This property provides an AsyncPublisher, which allows you to use the Swift async-await syntax to receive the publisher’s elements. Because AsyncPublisher conforms to AsyncSequence, you iterate over its elements with a for-await-in loop, rather than attaching a subscriber.
The following example shows how to use the values property to receive elements asynchronously. The example adapts a code snippet from the filter(_:) operator’s documentation, which filters a sequence to only emit even integers. This example replaces the Subscribers/Sink subscriber with a for-await-in loop that iterates over the AsyncPublisher provided by the values property.
let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let filtered = numbers.publisher
    .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }


for await number in filtered.values
{
    print("\(number)", terminator: " ")
}
