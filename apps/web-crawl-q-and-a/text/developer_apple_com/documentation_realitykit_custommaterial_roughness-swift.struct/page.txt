struct Roughness
Overview
In physically based rendering, the roughness property represents how much the surface of an entity scatters the light it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, whereas one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.
For more information on using roughness values in a custom material, see roughness.
Topics
Creating a Roughness Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an object to specify the amount of roughness, using a single value that applies to the entire material.
init(scale: Float, texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?)
Creates a roughness object from a color or texture.
init(PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Roughness)
Creates a roughness object from a physically based material’s roughness property.
Accessing Roughness Values
var scale: Float
The roughness value for the entire entity or a multiplier for its texture.
var texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?
The roughness values as a UV-mapped image texture.
typealias FloatLiteralType
An alias for the roughness type.
