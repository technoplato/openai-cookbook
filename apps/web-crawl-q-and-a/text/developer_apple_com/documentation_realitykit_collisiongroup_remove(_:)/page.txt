Instance Method
remove(_:)
Removes the given element and all elements subsumed by it.

@discardableResult
mutating func remove(_ member: Self.Element) -> Self.Element?
Available when Self is Self.Element.
Parameters
member
The element of the set to remove.
Return Value
The intersection of [member] and the set, if the intersection was nonempty; otherwise, nil.
Overview
In the following example, the .priority shipping option is removed from the options option set. Attempting to remove the same shipping option a second time results in nil, because options no longer contains .priority as a member.
var options: ShippingOptions = [.secondDay, .priority]
let priorityOption = options.remove(.priority)
print(priorityOption == .priority)
// Prints "true"


print(options.remove(.priority))
// Prints "nil"
In the next example, the .express element is passed to remove(_:). Although .express is not a member of options, .express subsumes the remaining .secondDay element of the option set. Therefore, options is emptied and the intersection between .express and options is returned.
let expressOption = options.remove(.express)
print(expressOption == .express)
// Prints "false"
print(expressOption == .secondDay)
// Prints "true"
