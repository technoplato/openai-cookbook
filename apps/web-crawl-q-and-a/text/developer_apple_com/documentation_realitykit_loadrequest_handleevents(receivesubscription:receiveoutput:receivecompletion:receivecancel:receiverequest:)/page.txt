func handleEvents(
    receiveSubscription: ((Subscription) -> Void)? = nil,
    receiveOutput: ((Self.Output) -> Void)? = nil,
    receiveCompletion: ((Subscribers.Completion<Self.Failure>) -> Void)? = nil,
    receiveCancel: (() -> Void)? = nil,
    receiveRequest: ((Subscribers.Demand) -> Void)? = nil
) -> Publishers.HandleEvents<Self>
Parameters
receiveSubscription
An optional closure that executes when the publisher receives the subscription from the upstream publisher. This value defaults to nil.
receiveOutput
An optional closure that executes when the publisher receives a value from the upstream publisher. This value defaults to nil.
receiveCompletion
An optional closure that executes when the upstream publisher finishes normally or terminates with an error. This value defaults to nil.
receiveCancel
An optional closure that executes when the downstream receiver cancels publishing. This value defaults to nil.
receiveRequest
An optional closure that executes when the publisher receives a request for more elements. This value defaults to nil.
Return Value
A publisher that performs the specified closures when publisher events occur.
Discussion
Use Publisher/handleEvents(receiveSubscription:receiveOutput:receiveCompletion:receiveCancel:receiveRequest:) when you want to examine elements as they progress through the stages of the publisher’s lifecycle.
In the example below, a publisher of integers shows the effect of printing debugging information at each stage of the element-processing lifecycle:
let integers = (0...2)
cancellable = integers.publisher
    .handleEvents(receiveSubscription: { subs in
        print("Subscription: \(subs.combineIdentifier)")
    }, receiveOutput: { anInt in
        print("in output handler, received \(anInt)")
    }, receiveCompletion: { _ in
        print("in completion handler")
    }, receiveCancel: {
        print("received cancel")
    }, receiveRequest: { (demand) in
        print("received demand: \(demand.description)")
    })
    .sink { _ in return }


// Prints:
//   received demand: unlimited
//   Subscription: 0x7f81284734c0
//   in output handler, received 0
//   in output handler, received 1
//   in output handler, received 2
//   in completion handler

Debugging
func breakpoint(receiveSubscription: ((Subscription) -> Bool)?, receiveOutput: ((Self.Output) -> Bool)?, receiveCompletion: ((Subscribers.Completion<Self.Failure>) -> Bool)?) -> Publishers.Breakpoint<Self>
Raises a debugger signal when a provided closure needs to stop the process in the debugger.
func breakpointOnError() -> Publishers.Breakpoint<Self>
Raises a debugger signal upon receiving a failure.
func print(String, to: (TextOutputStream)?) -> Publishers.Print<Self>
Prints log messages for all publishing events.
