var publisher: Publishers.Sequence<Self, Never>
Instance Methods
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
If lhs is ordered before rhs in the ordering described by the given sequence of SortComparators
func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool

func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Beta
func forEach((Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows

Available when Element conforms to StringProtocol.
func joined<Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence<Self>
Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (<) to compare elements.
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
