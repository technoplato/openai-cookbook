func confirmationDialog<A, M>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    titleVisibility: Visibility = .automatic,
    @ViewBuilder actions: () -> A,
    @ViewBuilder message: () -> M
) -> some View where A : View, M : View
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the localized string that describes the title of the dialog.
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the dialog. When the user presses or taps the dialog’s default action button, the system sets this value to false, dismissing the dialog.
titleVisibility
The visibility of the dialog’s title. The default value is Visibility/automatic.
actions
A view builder returning the dialog’s actions.
message
A view builder returning the message for the dialog.
Discussion
In the example below, a button conditionally presents a confirmation dialog depending upon the value of a bound Boolean variable. When the Boolean value is set to true, the system displays a confirmation dialog with a cancel action and a destructive action.
struct ConfirmEraseItems: View {
    @State private var isShowingDialog = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Empty Trash") {
            isShowingDialog = true
        }
        .confirmationDialog(
            "Permanently erase the items in the Trash?",
            isPresented: $isShowingDialog
        ) {
            Button("Empty Trash", role: .destructive) {
                // Handle empty trash action.
            }
        } message: {
            Text("You cannot undo this action.")
        }
    }
}
All actions in a confirmation dialog will dismiss the dialog after the action runs. The default button will be shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the KeyboardShortcut/defaultAction keyboard shortcut.
The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.
Dialogs include a standard dismiss action by default. If you provide a button with a role of ButtonRole/cancel, that button takes the place of the default dismiss action. You don’t have to dismiss the presentation with the cancel button’s action.
Note
In regular size classes in iOS, the system renders confirmation dialogs as a popover that the user dismisses by tapping anywhere outside the popover, rather than displaying the standard dismiss action.
On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, confirmation dialogs only support controls with labels that are Text. Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
This modifier creates a Text view for the title on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to Text/init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
