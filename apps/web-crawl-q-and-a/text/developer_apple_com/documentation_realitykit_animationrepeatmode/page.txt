enum AnimationRepeatMode
Overview
Adopters of AnimationDefinition, such as SampledAnimation, offer repeat options of this type through the repeatMode property.
To select a behavior, set the repeat mode as you configure your animation, as in the following example:
let clip = FromToByAnimation<Transform>()
clip.repeatMode = .repeat
Topics
Choosing a Repeat Mode
case `repeat`
A mode that restarts the animation after it completes.
case cumulative
A mode that repeats indefinitely and begins each repetition by setting the animated property to the ending value of the previous repetition.
case autoReverse
A mode that reverses the animation after reaching the end or the beginning.
case none
An option that determines the animation doesn’t repeat.
Comparing Repeat Modes
static func == (AnimationRepeatMode, AnimationRepeatMode) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two repeat modes are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two repeat modes aren’t equal.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of a value by feeding them into the given hasher.
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
