replace(applyToAllLayers:)
Keeps playing the current animation during the transition time and uses the value from that animation as the blend value for the transition to the new animation.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
static func replace(applyToAllLayers: Bool = true) -> AnimationHandoffType
Discussion
A Boolean value is used to define the following: false only replaces current animations that have the same layerId as the blendLayerOffset parameter in the playAnimation() call. true replaces all animations regardless of the layer.
