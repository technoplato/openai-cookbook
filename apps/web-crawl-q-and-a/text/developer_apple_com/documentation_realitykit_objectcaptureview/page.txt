struct ObjectCaptureView<Overlay> where Overlay : View
Overview
The primary view of the Object Capture front-end 3D UI. This view is used to present the UI for a given ObjectCaptureSession. It always presents the current state of the wrapped session. The view can be taken down temporarily to show the ObjectCapturePointCloudView or an app’s custom tutorial pages. If a ObjectCaptureView is removed from the content view, creating a new ObjectCaptureView from the original view’s ObjectCaptureSession resumes the in-progress capture session.
