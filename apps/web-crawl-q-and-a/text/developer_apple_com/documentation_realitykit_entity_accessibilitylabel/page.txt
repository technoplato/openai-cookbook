Discussion
The default value for this property is false.
For entities with isAccessibilityElement set to true, iOS uses this string to provide information to users of assistive technologies like VoiceOver. Set this property to a name or short description that accurately describes the entity. If you wish to provide additional information or a longer description of the entity, you can use accessibilityDescription.
