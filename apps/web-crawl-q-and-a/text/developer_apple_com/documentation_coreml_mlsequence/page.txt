class MLSequence : NSObject
Overview
A sequence stores a series of integers or strings of any length as the underlying type of an MLFeatureValue. Some classifier models — typically natural language models, such as an NLTagger — produce an MLSequence feature value from their output features.
Topics
Creating a Sequence
init(strings: [String])
Creates a sequence of strings from a string array.
init(int64s: [NSNumber])
Creates a sequence of integers from an array of numbers.
init(empty: MLFeatureType)
Creates an empty sequence of strings or integers.
Identifying the Sequence’s Element Type
var type: MLFeatureType
The underlying type of the sequence’s elements.
Retrieving the Sequence’s Values
var stringValues: [String]
An array of strings in the sequence.
var int64Values: [NSNumber]
An array of 64-bit integers in the sequence.
