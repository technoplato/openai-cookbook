@MainActor
var anchor: (HasAnchoring)? { get }
Discussion
This property returns nil if no ancestor can act as an anchor. An entity can act as an anchor if it adopts the HasAnchoring protocol. Just because an ancestor can be anchored doesn’t mean that it is. Inspect the isAnchored property to see if an entity (or one of its ancestors) is anchored.
