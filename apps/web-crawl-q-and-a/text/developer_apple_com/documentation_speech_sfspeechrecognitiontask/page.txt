Overview
Use an SFSpeechRecognitionTask object to determine the state of a speech recognition task, to cancel an ongoing task, or to signal the end of the task.
You don’t create speech recognition task objects directly. Instead, you receive one of these objects after calling recognitionTask(with:resultHandler:) or recognitionTask(with:delegate:) on your SFSpeechRecognizer object.
