var recognitionLevel: VNRequestTextRecognitionLevel { get set }
Discussion
The recognition level determines which techniques the request uses during the text recognition. Set this value to VNRequestTextRecognitionLevel.fast to prioritize speed over accuracy, and to VNRequestTextRecognitionLevel.accurate for longer, more computationally intensive recognition.
