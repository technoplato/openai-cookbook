auralMode
An option that controls the audio signal’s spacial dynamics.
Overview
The default value is blank. Each instance of AudioAction must specify an auralMode.
Aural Modes
spatial
Plays the audio in 3D space at the position of the affected object. If the device doesn’t support spatial audio, it falls back to mono. For best results in spatial mode, supply audio files in mono.
nonSpatial
Plays the audio without regard to the affected object’s 3D position. If the audio media contains any form of stereo or other multichannel sound, the runtime attempts to match this to the device’s output capabilities. Use this mode when an audio action doesn’t use the listener’s position to affect the music’s playback.
ambient
Plays the audio in a spatial configuration that tracks rotation, but does not attenuate with distance.
