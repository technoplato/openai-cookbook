struct Normal
Overview
Normal mapping is a real-time rendering technique that captures fine surface details for a model by using a texture instead of by increasing the number of polygons in the model. It works by storing surface normals, which are vectors perpendicular to the surface of the model, from a much higher-resolution version of the same 3D object. A normal map stores each vector in the image by storing the vectors’ X, Y, and Z values as the R, G, and B components of the corresponding pixel in the UV-mapped image. This object defines a normal map for a custom material.
For more information on using normal map values in a custom material, see normal.
Topics
Creating a Normal Object
init(texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?)
Create an object from a specified texture.
init(PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Normal)
Creates an object containing surface details for an entity from a custom material’s normal property.
Accessing the Normal Map
var texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?
The material’s normal map.
