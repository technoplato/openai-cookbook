Structure
PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Specular
An object that defines the specular highlights of an entity.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct Specular
Overview
RealityKit automatically draws specular highlights for physically based materials, using the values of various properties, primarily roughness and metallic. Specular highlights are bright spots of reflected light that appear on shiny objects.
Although many real-world objects can be accurately and realistically simulated with just the core physically based rendering (PBR) properties, you can create additional realistic effects by augmenting the specular highlights.
Use this object to specify the amount of specular for a PhysicallyBasedMaterial.
Topics
Creating a Specular Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an object from single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates an object from a single value or a texture.
init(CustomMaterial.Specular)
Creates an object from a custom material’s specular property.
Accessing Specular Values
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The amount of specular as a UV-mapped image texture.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of the object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The amount of specular for the entire entity.
typealias FloatLiteralType
An alias for the type used to specify a single specular value for this material.

An object that defines the intensity of an entity’s clear, shiny coating.
var clearcoatRoughness: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness
The degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.
struct ClearcoatRoughness
An object that defines the degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.
