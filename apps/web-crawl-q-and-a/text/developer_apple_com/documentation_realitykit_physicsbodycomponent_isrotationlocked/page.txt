Instance Property
isRotationLocked
A tuple of Boolean values that you use to lock rotation of the physics body around any of the three axes.

var isRotationLocked: (x: Bool, y: Bool, z: Bool)
Discussion
For any one of the three Booleans in the tuple that you set to true, rotation is restricted on the axis represented by that item. For example, if you set the x item to true, then the body can’t rotate around the x-axis. By default, rotation isn’t restricted.
