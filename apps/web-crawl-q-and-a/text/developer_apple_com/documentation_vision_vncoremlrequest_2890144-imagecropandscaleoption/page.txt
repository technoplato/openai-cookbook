An optional setting that tells the Vision algorithm how to scale an input image.

var imageCropAndScaleOption: VNImageCropAndScaleOption { get set }
Discussion
Scaling an image ensures that the entire image fits into the algorithm’s input image dimensions, which may require a change in aspect ratio. Each crop-and-scale option transforms the input image in a different way.
