class VNDetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest : VNImageBasedRequest
Overview
This request produces or updates a VNFaceObservation object’s property faceCaptureQuality with a floating-point value. The value ranges from 0 to 1. Faces with quality closer to 1 are better lit, sharper, and more centrally positioned than faces with quality closer to 0.
If you don’t execute the request, or the request fails, the property faceCaptureQuality is nil.
