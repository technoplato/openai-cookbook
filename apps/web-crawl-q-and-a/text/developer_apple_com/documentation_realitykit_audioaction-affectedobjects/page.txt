affectedObjects
A list of prims that play audio.
Overview
This action plays audio located in 3D space to the position of the affected objects when the action’s auralMode is set to spatial.
The runtime requires a separate AudioAction for each prim from which an asset intends to play audio. As a result, the runtime plays audio only from the first prim in a list.
