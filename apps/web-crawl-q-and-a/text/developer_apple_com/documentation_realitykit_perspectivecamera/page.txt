class PerspectiveCamera
Overview
During an AR session, RealityKit automatically uses the device’s camera to define the perspective from which to render the scene. When rendering a scene outside of an AR session (with the view’s cameraMode property set to ARView.CameraMode.nonAR), RealityKit uses a PerspectiveCamera instead. You can add a perspective camera anywhere in your scene to control the point of view. If you don’t explicitly provide one, RealityKit creates a default camera for you.
Topics
Creating a Camera
init()
Creates a perspective camera entity.
Configuring the Camera
var camera: PerspectiveCameraComponent
A camera component for the perspective camera entity.
struct PerspectiveCameraComponent
In AR applications, the camera is automatically provided by the system. In non-AR scenarios, the camera needs to be set by the app. (If no camera is provided by the app, the system will use default camera.)
protocol HasPerspectiveCamera
An interface that enables you to configure a virtual camera that you can use to define the rendering perspective when you’re not in an AR session.
