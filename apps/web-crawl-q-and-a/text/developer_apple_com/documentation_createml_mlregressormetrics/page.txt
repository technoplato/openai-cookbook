struct MLRegressorMetrics
Overview
To understand what performance you can expect from the regressor, you start by looking at its maximumError. This high-level metric indicates your model’s worst-case performance. To get a sense for how your model performs on average, look at the rootMeanSquaredError. In both cases, you want to minimize the value and therefore the error.
Note
Each trained model contains different metrics for its various data sets (training, validation, and testing). Improving Your Model’s Accuracy compares these metrics among different data sets.
Topics
Understanding the Model
var maximumError: Double
The largest absolute difference between the expected values and the model’s predicted values during testing or training.
var rootMeanSquaredError: Double
A common metric used to determine the deviation between correct and predicted values.
Handling Errors
var isValid: Bool
A Boolean value indicating whether the regressor model was able to calculate metrics.
var error: (Error)?
The underlying error present when the metrics are invalid.
Creating Metrics
init(maximumError: Double, rootMeanSquaredError: Double)
Creates regressor metrics describing the quality of your model.
Describing Metrics
var description: String
A text representation of the regressor metrics.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the regressor metrics that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the regressor metrics shown in a playground.
