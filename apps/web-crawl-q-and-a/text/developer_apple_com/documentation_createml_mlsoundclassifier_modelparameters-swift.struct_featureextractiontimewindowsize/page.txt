Instance Property
featureExtractionTimeWindowSize
A time duration, in seconds, the training session uses for each audio sample it reads from an audio file in a dataset.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var featureExtractionTimeWindowSize: TimeInterval { get set }
Discussion
The time-window size value defaults to 0.975 seconds and must be in the range [0.5, 15.0].
Training sessions that use MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType.vggish(revision:) ignore this value and always use a time-window size of 0.975 seconds.

Accessing the Training Parameters
var validation: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData
The sound classifier’s validation dataset.
var maxIterations: Int
The largest number of iterations the training session can use.
var overlapFactor: Double
The proportion of overlap that the training session uses to analyze two consecutive windows in the audio data.
var algorithm: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ModelAlgorithmType
The algorithm the training session uses to train the sound classifier.
