func listItemTint(_ tint: ListItemTint?) -> some View
Parameters
tint
The tint effect to use, or nil to not override the inherited tint.
Discussion
The containing list’s style will apply that tint as appropriate. watchOS uses the tint color for its background platter appearance. Sidebars on iOS and macOS apply the tint color to their Label icons, which otherwise use the accent color by default.
Beta Software
