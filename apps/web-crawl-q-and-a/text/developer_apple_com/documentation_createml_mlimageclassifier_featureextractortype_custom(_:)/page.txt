case custom(MLImageClassifier.CustomFeatureExtractor)
Parameters
_
custom feature extractor to be used for extracting features.
Discussion
A custom feature extractor is a neural network model you provide to an MLImageClassifier. The feature extractor can be a layer within the model or the model itself. In either case, the neural network must take an image as input and output an MLMultiArray.
