func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Return Value
A random element from the collection. If the collection is empty, the method returns nil.
Overview
Call randomElement() to select a random element from an array or another collection. This example picks a name at random from an array:
let names = ["Zoey", "Chloe", "Amani", "Amaia"]
let randomName = names.randomElement()!
// randomName == "Amani"
This method is equivalent to calling randomElement(using:), passing in the system’s default random generator.
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
