Sets the view’s background to a shape filled with the default background style.

func background<S>(
    in shape: S,
    fillStyle: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : Shape
Parameters
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to Shape that SwiftUI draws behind the view using the ShapeStyle/background shape style.
fillStyle
The FillStyle to use when drawing the shape. The default style uses the nonzero winding number rule and antialiasing.
Return Value
A view with the specified shape drawn behind it.
Discussion
This modifier behaves like View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j, except that it always uses the ShapeStyle/background shape style to fill the specified shape. For example, you can create a Path that outlines a trapezoid:
let trapezoid = Path { path in
    path.move(to: .zero)
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 90, y: 0))
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 80, y: 50))
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 10, y: 50))
}
Then you can use that shape as a background for a Label:
ZStack {
    Color.teal
    Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
        .padding()
        .background(in: trapezoid)
}
Without the background modifier, the fill color shows through the label. With the modifier, the label’s text and icon appear backed by a shape filled with a color that’s appropriate for light or dark appearance:
To create a background with other View types — or with a stack of views — use View/background(alignment:content:) instead. To add a ShapeStyle as a background, use View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:).
