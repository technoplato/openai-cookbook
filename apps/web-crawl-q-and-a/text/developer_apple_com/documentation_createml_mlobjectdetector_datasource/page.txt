Enumeration
MLObjectDetector.DataSource
A data source for an object detector.

Overview
You use a data source to specify the training dataset for an MLObjectDetector training session. An object-detector data source represents a set of images and an annotation for each object in an image.
Each object annotation consists of the object’s name, or label, and its location in the image. A single image can have multiple objects and, therefore, multiple annotations. For example, you can train an object detector with images of dining tables, along with annotations for bananas, croissants, and beverages. Each image can have one or more instances of an object, or any combination of objects.
Topics
Creating a Data Source
case directoryWithImagesAndJsonAnnotation(at: URL)
An object-detector data source you create by selecting a directory that contains image files and exactly one JSON annotation file.
case directoryWithImages(at: URL, annotationFile: URL)
An object-detector data source you create by selecting the location of a directory of image files, and the location of a JSON annotation file.
case table(MLDataTable, imageColumn: String, annotationColumn: String)
An object-detector data source you create with a data table.
Getting the Annotated File Names
func gatherAnnotatedFileNames() throws -> DataFrame
Processes the data source and returns a data frame that contains file URLs and annotations.
Beta
Getting the Data Frame
case frame(DataFrame, imageColumn: String, annotationColumn: String)
Data specified by a DataFrame containing a column for image file paths and a column with annotations.
Retrieving the Data
func imagesWithObjectAnnotations() throws -> MLDataTable
Generates a data table where each row represents an image, and its columns are the image file URLs and its annotations.
Splitting the Data
func stratifiedSplit(proportions: [Double], seed: Int, annotationColumn: String) throws -> MLDataTable
Generates a new data table by splitting the data source using the specified proportions.
