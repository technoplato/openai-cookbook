func dynamicTypeSize(_ size: DynamicTypeSize) -> some View
Parameters
size
The size to set for this view.
Return Value
A view that sets the Dynamic Type size to the specified size.
Discussion
As an example, you can set a Dynamic Type size in ContentView to be DynamicTypeSize/xLarge (this can be useful in previews to see your content at a different size) like this:
ContentView()
    .dynamicTypeSize(.xLarge)
If a Dynamic Type size range is applied after setting a value, the value is limited by that range:
ContentView() // Dynamic Type size will be .large
    .dynamicTypeSize(...DynamicTypeSize.large)
    .dynamicTypeSize(.xLarge)
When limiting the Dynamic Type size, consider if adding a large content view with View/accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer() would be appropriate.
