Structure
PhysicallyBasedMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness
An object that defines the degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.

struct ClearcoatRoughness
Overview
This object specifies clearcoat roughness for entities that have clearcoat enabled. A clearcoat is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear coating, like on a car or the surface of lacquered objects. When you enable clearcoat rendering for a material, RealityKit renders the clearcoat as a separate layer just above the surface of the entity. You can specify a clearcoat roughness value to indicate how much the clearcoat scatters light that bounces off of it, which softens and spreads out the highlights.
Topics
Creating a Clearcoat Roughness Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates a clearcoat roughness object using a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates a clearcoat roughness object using a single value or a texture.
init(CustomMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness)
Creates a clearcoat roughness object from a custom material’s clearcoat roughness property.
Accessing Clearcoat Roughness Values
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The clearcoat roughness specified using a UV-mapped image.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of this object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The clearcoat roughness specified as a single value.
typealias FloatLiteralType
The type of scalar value this parameter uses.
