class VNImageTranslationAlignmentObservation : VNImageAlignmentObservation
Overview
This type of observation results from a VNTranslationalImageRegistrationRequest, informing the alignmentTransform performed to align the input images.
Topics
Determining Alignment
var alignmentTransform: CGAffineTransform
The alignment transform to align the floating image with the reference image.
Identifying Request Revisions
let VNTranslationalImageRegistrationRequestRevision1: Int
A constant for specifying revision 1 of the translational image registration request.
