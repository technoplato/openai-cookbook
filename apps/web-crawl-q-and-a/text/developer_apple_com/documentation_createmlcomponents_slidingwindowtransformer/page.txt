Structure
SlidingWindowTransformer
A temporal transformer that groups input elements.

iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct SlidingWindowTransformer<Input> where Input : Sendable
Topics
Creating the Transformer
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
init(stride: Int, length: Int)
Creates a window temporal transformer.
Getting the Properties
let length: Int
The length of a window.
let stride: Int
The number of elements between the start of two consecutive windows.
Performing the Transformation
typealias Input
The input type.
typealias Output
The output type.
struct WindowSequence
An async sequence of windows.
Available when Input conforms to Sendable.
Instance Methods
func applied<S>(to: S, eventHandler: EventHandler?) throws -> SlidingWindowTransformer<Input>.WindowSequence
Extracts a window sequence from the input sequence
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
Type Aliases
typealias OutputSequence
The output async sequence type.
