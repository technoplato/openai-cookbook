func location(in entity: Entity?) -> SIMD3<Float>?
Parameters
entity
An entity in whose space the location is computed. A nil entity will result in world space.
Return Value
The 3D position identifying the location of the gesture in the space specified.
Discussion
The location is typically the result of a centroid of touches for a gesture, unprojected onto the associated entity, and then converted into the space of the entity passed in, or world space if nil is passed in.
