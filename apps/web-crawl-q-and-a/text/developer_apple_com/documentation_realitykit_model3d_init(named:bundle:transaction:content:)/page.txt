Swift
Initializer
init(named:bundle:transaction:content:)
Loads and displays a modifiable model by name, by searching through the specified Bundle, in phases.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    named name: String,
    bundle: Bundle? = nil,
    transaction: Transaction = Transaction(),
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Model3DPhase) -> Content
)
Parameters
name
The name of the USD or Reality file to display.
bundle
The Bundle used to look up the model by name. If not provided, defaults to the app’s main bundle.
transaction
The transaction to use when the phase changes.
content
A closure that takes the load phase as an input, and returns the view to display for the specified phase.
Discussion
Before the load operation completes, the phase is Model3DPhase.empty. After the operation completes, the phase becomes either Model3DPhase.failure(_:) or Model3DPhase.success(_:). In the first case, the phase’s error value indicates the reason for failure. In the second case, the phase’s model property contains the loaded model. Use the phase to drive the output of the content closure, which defines the view’s appearance:
    Model3D(named: "Robot-Drummer") { phase in
        if let model = phase.model {
            model // Displays the loaded model.
        } else if phase.error != nil {
            Color.red // Indicates an error.
        } else {
            Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder.
        }
    }
To add transitions when you change the name, apply an identifier to the Model3D.
