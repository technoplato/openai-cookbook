Parameters
scale
The reflectiveness value.
texture
An optional image texture.
Discussion
In PBR rendering, the metallic property represents the reflectiveness of an entity. This initializer creates a new object from a single value to describe the reflectiveness of the entire material. This initializer creates a new object from a single value or a grayscale image texture, or from both.
If you specify texture, RealityKit calculates the metallic for the entity by UV-mapping texture onto the entity and multiplying the value of each mapped pixel by scale. If you don’t specify texture, then RealityKit uses scale as the entire entity’s reflectiveness. If you provide a color image for texture rather than a grayscale image, RealityKit only uses the intensity of the image’s red channel.
