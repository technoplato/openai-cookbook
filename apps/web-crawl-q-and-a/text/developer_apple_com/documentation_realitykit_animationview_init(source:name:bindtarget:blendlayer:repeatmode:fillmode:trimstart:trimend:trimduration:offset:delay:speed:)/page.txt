init(
    source: AnimationDefinition,
    name: String = "",

)
Parameters
source
The original animation that this structure modifies.
name
A textual name for the animation.
bindTarget
A textual name that identifies the animated property.
blendLayer
The order in which the framework visually composites the animation among other running animations.
repeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats outside the length of the view.
fillMode
The behavior when the animated property reaches its end value.
trimStart
The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.
trimEnd
The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.
trimDuration
An optional duration that overrides the caculated duration.
offset
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
delay
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
speed
A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s playback rate.
