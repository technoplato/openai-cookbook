Discussion
When determining which entities are currently visible, RealityKit tests each entity’s bounding box to see if it overlaps with the camera’s field of view (also known as the camera’s frustum). For efficiency, entities with a bounding box that don’t overlap the camera’s frustum aren’t rendered. Use this property to prevent RealityKit from incorrectly culling entities that use a CustomMaterial with a geometry modifier that moves vertices outside of the entity’s bounding box.
RealityKit adds the value of boundsMargin to the bounding box before determining which entities are visible.
