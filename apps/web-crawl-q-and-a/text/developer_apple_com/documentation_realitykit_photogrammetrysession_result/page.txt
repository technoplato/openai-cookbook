enum Result
Overview
When PhotogrammetrySession completes a PhotogrammetrySession.Request, it publishes a PhotogrammetrySession.Output.requestComplete(_:_:) message to output, and includes the created object as the associated value of the result parameter. The result type corresponds to the request type. For example, a PhotogrammetrySession.Request.modelFile(url:detail:geometry:) request results in the session publishing a PhotogrammetrySession.Result.modelFile(_:).
Topics
Types of Output
case modelFile(URL)
The result of a request for a USDZ file.
case modelEntity(ModelEntity)
The result of a request for an in-memory entity.
case bounds(BoundingBox)
The result of a request for a bounding box.
Enumeration Cases
case pointCloud(PhotogrammetrySession.PointCloud)
The result of a request for a point cloud.
case poses(PhotogrammetrySession.Poses)
Once initial photogrammetric calculations are complete, a data structure mapping each sample ID (or index if a folder was used) to the 6DOF algorithmically estimated pose of that sample is returned.
