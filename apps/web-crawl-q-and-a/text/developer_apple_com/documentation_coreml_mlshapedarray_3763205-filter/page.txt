Instance Method
filter(_:)
Returns an array containing, in order, the elements of the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
Xcode 13.0+
func filter(_ isIncluded: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>]
Parameters
isIncluded
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the returned array.
Return Value
An array of the elements that isIncluded allowed.
Discussion
In this example, filter(_:) is used to include only names shorter than five characters.
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let shortNames = cast.filter { $0.count < 5 }
print(shortNames)
// Prints "["Kim", "Karl"]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

Transforming a Shaped Array
func map<T>((MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> T) -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> ElementOfResult?) -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> SegmentOfResult) -> [SegmentOfResult.Element]
Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> ElementOfResult?) -> [ElementOfResult]
Generates an array that concatenates the sequences from a transform closure that returns an optional.
Deprecated
func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Result) -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> ()) -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
