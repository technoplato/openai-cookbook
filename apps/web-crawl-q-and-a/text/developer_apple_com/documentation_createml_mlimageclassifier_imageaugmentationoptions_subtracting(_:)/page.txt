Parameters
other
A set of the same type as the current set.
Return Value
A new set.
Discussion
In the following example, the nonNeighbors set is made up of the elements of the employees set that are not elements of neighbors:
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
let nonNeighbors = employees.subtracting(neighbors)
print(nonNeighbors)
// Prints "["Diana", "Chris", "Alicia"]"
