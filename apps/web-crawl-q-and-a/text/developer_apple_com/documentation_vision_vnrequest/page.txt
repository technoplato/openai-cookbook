class VNRequest : NSObject
Overview
Other Vision request handlers that perform image analysis inherit from this abstract base class. Instantiate one of its subclasses to perform image analysis.
Topics
Initializing a Request
init()
Creates a new Vision request with no completion handler.
init(completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)
Creates a new Vision request with an optional completion handler.
Configuring a Request
var completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?
The completion handler the system invokes after the request finishes processing.
var preferBackgroundProcessing: Bool
A hint to minimize the resource burden of the request.
var results: [VNObservation]?
The collection of VNObservation results generated by request processing.
var usesCPUOnly: Bool
A Boolean signifying that the Vision request should execute exclusively on the CPU.
Deprecated
var revision: Int
The specific algorithm or implementation revision that’s used to perform the request.
Canceling a Request
func cancel()
Cancels the request before it can finish executing.
Executing a Completion Handler
typealias VNRequestCompletionHandler
A type alias to encapsulate the syntax for the completion handler the system calls after the request finishes processing.
Determining the Revision
protocol VNRequestRevisionProviding
A protocol for specifying the revision number of Vision algorithms.
class var currentRevision: Int
The current revison supported by the request.
class var defaultRevision: Int
The revision of the latest request for the particular SDK linked with the client application.
class var supportedRevisions: IndexSet
The collection of currently-supported algorithm versions for the class of request.
