Initializer
init(validationData:maxDepth:maxIterations:minLossReduction:minChildWeight:randomSeed:stepSize:earlyStoppingRounds:rowSubsample:columnSubsample:)

    validationData: MLDataTable?,
    maxDepth: Int = 6,
    maxIterations: Int = 10,

Parameters
validationData
The dataset used to monitor how well the model is generalizing.
The default value is nil which will use an automatically sampled validation set.
maxDepth
The maximum depth of the tree. Must be a value of at least 1.
The default value is 6.
maxIterations
The maximum number of passes through the data. Each iteration creates an extra tree.
The default value is 10.
minLossReduction
The minimum amount of reduction in the loss function that is required to make another split to the data. Larger values help prevent overfitting.
The default value is 0.
minChildWeight
Determines the minimum weight of each leaf node of the tree. Larger values help prevent overfitting.
The default value is 0.1.
randomSeed
A seed for internal random operations. Set this value to ensure reproducible results.
The default value is 42.
stepSize
The shrinkage used to decrease the prediction weight of each learner. The smaller the step size the more conservative the boosting process will be.
The default value is 0.3.
earlyStoppingRounds
If the validation accuracy does not improve after the specified number of rounds training will stop.
rowSubsample
Select the specified ratio from the training set to grow each tree. For example, a value of 0.5 means each tree is trained on half the data. This technique is known as bagging.
The default value is 1.0.
columnSubsample
Select the specified ratio of columns from the training set to use when growing each tree. Similar to row subsampling, this can be used to prevent overfitting.
The default value is 1.0.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
