preliminary:anchoring:type
A option that specifies the type of anchor.
Overview
The Preliminary_AnchoringAPI specifies an anchor’s center as the prim’s origin, and the top of the anchor as its normal vector points. The runtime requires an asset to supply a value for this property.
Declaration
uniform token preliminary:anchoring:type (
    allowedTokens = ["plane", "image", "face", "none"]
)
Anchor Types
plane
Requests that the runtime center the prim on top of a surface.
image
Requests that the runtime center the prim on top of an image.
face
Requests that the runtime center the prim on a detected face.
none
Requests that the runtime doesn’t anchor the prim. This option has the same effect as omitting the anchoring schema.
Anchor a Cube to a Real-World Surface
By adding the anchoring schema and defining preliminary:anchoring:type of plane, the following cube instructs the runtime to place it on the first horizontal surface the runtime detects in an AR experience.
def Cube "PlaneAnchoredCube" (
    prepend apiSchemas = [ "Preliminary_AnchoringAPI" ]
)
{
    uniform token preliminary:anchoring:type = "plane"
    ...
}
