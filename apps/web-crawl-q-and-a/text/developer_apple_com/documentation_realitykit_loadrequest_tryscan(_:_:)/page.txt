Swift
Instance Method
tryScan(_:_:)
Transforms elements from the upstream publisher by providing the current element to an error-throwing closure along with the last value returned by the closure.

func tryScan<T>(
    _ initialResult: T,
    _ nextPartialResult: @escaping (T, Self.Output) throws -> T
) -> Publishers.TryScan<Self, T>
Parameters
initialResult
The previous result returned by the nextPartialResult closure.
nextPartialResult
An error-throwing closure that takes as its arguments the previous value returned by the closure and the next element emitted from the upstream publisher.
Return Value
A publisher that transforms elements by applying a closure that receives its previous return value and the next element from the upstream publisher.
Discussion
Use Publisher/tryScan(_:_:) to accumulate all previously-published values into a single value, which you then combine with each newly-published value. If your accumulator closure throws an error, the publisher terminates with the error.
In the example below, Publisher/tryScan(_:_:) calls a division function on elements of a collection publisher. The Publishers/TryScan publisher publishes each result until the function encounters a DivisionByZeroError, which terminates the publisher.
struct DivisionByZeroError: Error {}


/// A function that throws a DivisionByZeroError if `current` provided by the TryScan publisher is zero.
func myThrowingFunction(_ lastValue: Int, _ currentValue: Int) throws -> Int {
    guard currentValue != 0 else { throw DivisionByZeroError() }
    return (lastValue + currentValue) / currentValue
 }


let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,9]
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .tryScan(10) { try myThrowingFunction($0, $1) }
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("\($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print ("\($0)", terminator: " ") }
     )


// Prints: "11 6 3 1 1 -1 failure(DivisionByZeroError())".
If the closure throws an error, the publisher fails with the error.

func flatMap<T, P>(maxPublishers: Subscribers.Demand, (Self.Output) -> P) -> Publishers.FlatMap<P, Self>
Transforms all elements from an upstream publisher into a new publisher up to a maximum number of publishers you specify.
func mapError<E>((Self.Failure) -> E) -> Publishers.MapError<Self, E>
Converts any failure from the upstream publisher into a new error.
func replaceNil<T>(with: T) -> Publishers.Map<Self, T>
