func tryFilter(_ isIncluded: @escaping (Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryFilter<Self>
Parameters
isIncluded
A closure that takes one element and returns a Boolean value that indicated whether to republish the element or throws an error.
Return Value
A publisher that republishes all elements that satisfy the closure.
Discussion
Use tryFilter(_:) to filter elements evaluated in an error-throwing closure. If the isIncluded closure throws an error, the publisher fails with that error.
In the example below, tryFilter(_:) checks to see if the element provided by the publisher is zero, and throws a ZeroError before terminating the publisher with the thrown error. Otherwise, it republishes the element only if it’s even:
struct ZeroError: Error {}


let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5]
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .tryFilter{
        if $0 == 0 {
            throw ZeroError()
        } else {
            return $0 % 2 == 0
        }
    }
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("\($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print ("\($0)", terminator: " ") }
     )


// Prints: "2 4 failure(DivisionByZeroError())".
