func edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_ edges: Edge.Set) -> some View
Parameters
edges
The set of the edges in which to expand the size requested for this view.
Return Value
A view that may extend outside of the screen’s safe area on the edges specified by edges.
Discussion
Use edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) to change the area proposed for this view so that — were the proposal accepted — this view could extend outside the safe area to the bounds of the screen for the specified edges.
For example, you can propose that a text view ignore the safe area’s top inset:
VStack {
    Text("This text is outside of the top safe area.")
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea([.top])
        .border(Color.purple)
    Text("This text is inside VStack.")
        .border(Color.yellow)
}
.border(Color.gray)
Depending on the surrounding view hierarchy, SwiftUI may not honor an edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) request. This can happen, for example, if the view is inside a container that respects the screen’s safe area. In that case you may need to apply edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) to the container instead.
