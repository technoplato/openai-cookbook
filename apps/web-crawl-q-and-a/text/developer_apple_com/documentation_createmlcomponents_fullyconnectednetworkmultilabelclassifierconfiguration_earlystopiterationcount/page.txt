var earlyStopIterationCount: Int
Discussion
The fitted method will stop if no significant progress is made for this many iterations. Significant progress happens when the validation loss decreases by at least earlyStoppingTolerance.
Defaults to 10.
Note
Early stopping only happens when using the fitted method with validation data.
