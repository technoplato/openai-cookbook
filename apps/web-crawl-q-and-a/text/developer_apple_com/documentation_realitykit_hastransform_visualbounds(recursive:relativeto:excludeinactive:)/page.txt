Instance Method
visualBounds(recursive:relativeTo:excludeInactive:)
Computes a bounding box for the entity in the specified space, optionally including child entities.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func visualBounds(
    recursive: Bool = true,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?,
    excludeInactive: Bool = false
) -> BoundingBox
Parameters
recursive
A Boolean that you set to true to incorporate the bounds of all descendants.
referenceEntity
An entity that defines a frame of reference. Set to nil to indicate world space.
Return Value
The bounding box.
Discussion
The method has complexity O(n), where n is the number of entities in the hierarchy.
excludeInactive: A Boolean that you set to true to exclude inactive entities.
