Instance Method
moveCharacter(by:deltaTime:relativeTo:collisionHandler:)
Moves the character along a specified vector over a period of time.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@discardableResult @MainActor
func moveCharacter(
    by moveDelta: SIMD3<Float>,
    deltaTime: Float,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?,
    collisionHandler: ((CharacterControllerComponent.Collision) -> Void)? = nil
) -> CharacterControllerComponent.CollisionFlags
Parameters
moveDelta
Delta vector to attempt to move capsule in collision world.
deltaTime
Time between last frame and current.
referenceEntity
Reference entity that defines the frame of reference of the move delta. Can be nil, which is equivalent to “world space”.
collisionHandler
Optional callback when an entity was hit. One call per each hit entity.
Return Value
Collision flags that indicate the location of the collision.
Discussion
Moves the character in the collision world, with continuous collision checking and response. This will create character collision events. Entity.transform will be updated on the next engine tick. Use CharacterControllerStateComponent to get additional information about the state of the character after the move.
