Swift
Operator
!=(_:_:)
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two collections of joints are not equal.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
static func != (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool
Parameters
lhs
The collection of joints on the left side of the operator.
rhs
The collection of joints on the right side of the operator.
Return Value
Returns true if the two collections of joints aren’t equal. Otherwise, returns false.
Overview
Inequality is the inverse of equality. For any values a and b, a != b implies that a == b is false.
This is the default implementation of the not-equal-to operator (!=) for any type that conforms to Equatable.
