Type Method
generateConvex(from:)
Creates a convex shape from the given points asynchronously.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
nonisolated static func generateConvex(from points: [SIMD3<Float>]) async throws -> ShapeResource
Return Value
A new ShapeResource object defined by the convex hull of points.
Discussion
points: An array of 3D points that define the convex polyhedron. Keep the number of points small to avoid hurting performance.
Throws
Will throw an error if points do not define a nonempty convex volume. For example, will fail if all of the points in points are coplanar.
