Initializer
init(pitch:yaw:roll:)
Creates a new transform from the specified Euler angles.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    pitch x: Float = 0,
    yaw y: Float = 0,
    roll z: Float = 0
)
Parameters
x
The rotation around the x-axis in radians.
y
The rotation around the y-axis in radians.
z
The rotation around the z-axis in radians.
Discussion
The rotation order using intrinsic rotation order is defined as:
Rotate around y-axis (yaw). 2. Rotate around the body-fixed x-axis (pitch). 3. Rotate around the body-fixed z-axis (roll).
The rotation order using extrinsic rotation order is defined as:
Rotate around the z-axis (roll). 2. Rotate around the world space x-axis (pitch). 3. Rotate around the world space y-axis (yaw).
