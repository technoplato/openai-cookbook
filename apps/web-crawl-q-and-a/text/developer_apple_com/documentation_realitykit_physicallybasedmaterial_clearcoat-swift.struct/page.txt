struct Clearcoat
Overview
A clearcoat is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear coating, like on a car or the surface of lacquered objects.
Topics
Creating a Clearcoat Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates a clearcoat object using a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates a clearcoat object using a single value or a texture.
init(CustomMaterial.Clearcoat)
Creates a clearcoat object from a custom material’s clearcoat property.
Accessing Clearcoat Values
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The clearcoat intensity specified using a UV-mapped image.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of the object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The clearcoat intensity specified as a single value.
typealias FloatLiteralType
The type of scalar value this parameter uses.
