Cameras and lighting
Control the lighting and point of view for a scene.
Overview
In RealityKit, cameras define the point of view from which a scene is rendered. In AR mode, RealityKit creates and controls the camera for you based on the location and orientation of the device. In non-AR mode, control the camera by making changes to the transform component of the PerspectiveCamera entity.
Topics
Cameras
class PerspectiveCamera
A virtual camera that establishes the rendering perspective.
struct PerspectiveCameraComponent
In AR applications, the camera is automatically provided by the system. In non-AR scenarios, the camera needs to be set by the app. (If no camera is provided by the app, the system will use default camera.)
Lighting
class PointLight
An entity that produces an omnidirectional light for virtual objects.
struct PointLightComponent
A component that defines a point light source.
class DirectionalLight
An entity that casts a virtual light in a particular direction.
struct DirectionalLightComponent
A component that defines a directional light source.
class SpotLight
An entity that illuminates virtual content in a cone-shaped volume.
struct SpotLightComponent
A component that defines a spotlight source.

Entity Compliance
protocol HasPerspectiveCamera
An interface that enables you to configure a virtual camera that you can use to define the rendering perspective when you’re not in an AR session.
protocol HasPointLight
An interface that defines a point light source component.
protocol HasDirectionalLight
An interface that defines a directional light source component.
protocol HasSpotLight
An interface that defines a spot light source component.
