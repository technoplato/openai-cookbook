Discussion
A spot light’s innerAngle and outerAngle reflect the size of the light’s cone, which shines relative to the entity’s forward direction (0, 0, -1). The light is at full intensity between 0° and innerAngle. RealityKit attenuates the light’s intensity between innerAngle and outerAngle. Beyond outerAngle, the light intensity is 0.0.
