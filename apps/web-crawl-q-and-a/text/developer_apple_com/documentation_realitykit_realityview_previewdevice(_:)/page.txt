func previewDevice(_ value: PreviewDevice?) -> some View
Parameters
value
A device to use for preview, or nil to let Xcode automatically choose a device based on the run destination.
Return Value
A preview that uses the given device.
Discussion
By default, Xcode automatically chooses a preview device based on your currently selected run destination. If you want to choose a device that doesn’t change based on Xcode settings, provide a PreviewDevice instance that you initialize with the name or model of a specific device:
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPad Pro (11-inch)"))
    }
}
You can get a list of supported preview device names, like “iPhone 11”, “iPad Pro (11-inch)”, and “Apple Watch Series 5 - 44mm”, by using the xcrun command in the Terminal app:
% xcrun simctl list devicetypes
Additionally, you can use the following values for macOS platform development:
“Mac”
“Mac Catalyst”
