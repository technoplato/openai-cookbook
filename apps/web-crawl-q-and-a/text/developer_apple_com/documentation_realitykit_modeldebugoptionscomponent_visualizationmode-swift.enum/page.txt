Topics
Visualization Modes
case none
A mode that doesn’t display a visualization.
case normal
A mode that displays the normal vectors as a color.
case tangent
A mode that displays the surface tangent vectors as a color.
case bitangent
A mode that displays the surface bitangent vectors as a color.
case baseColor
A mode that displays the entity’s base color with no lighting or material properties applied.
case textureCoordinates
A mode that displays the texture coordinates as a color.
case finalColor
A mode that displays the entity’s calculated color, ignoring transparency.
case finalAlpha
A mode that displays the entity’s calculated transparency as its surface color.
case roughness
A mode that displays the shininess of a material as the surface color.
case metallic
A mode that displays the reflectiveness of an entity as its surface color.
case ambientOcclusion
A mode that displays the calculated ambient occlusion value as the surface color.
case specular
A mode that displays en entitiy’s shininess as its surface color.
case emissive
A mode that displays the emissive channel of a material as the surface color.
case clearcoat
A mode that displays the clearcoat channel of a material as the surface color.
case clearcoatRoughness
A mode that displays the clearcoat roughness channel of a material as the surface color.
case lightingDiffuse
A mode that displays the intensity of indirect light hitting the entity as its surface color.
case lightingSpecular
A mode that displays the intensity of direct light hitting the entity as its surface color.
Raw Values
init?(rawValue: String)
Initializes a visualization mode from a raw string value.
var rawValue: String
The corresponding value of the raw type.
typealias RawValue
The datatype used for raw values.
Comparators
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Available when Self conforms to Hashable and RawValue conforms to Hashable.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Passes a visualization mode’s raw value to the specified hash function.
Available when Self conforms to Hashable and RawValue conforms to Hashable.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Compares two values to see if they aren’t equal.
Enumeration Cases
case distanceToGazeHitPoint
