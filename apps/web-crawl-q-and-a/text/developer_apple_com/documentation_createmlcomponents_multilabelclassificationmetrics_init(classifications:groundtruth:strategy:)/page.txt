Initializer
init(classifications:groundTruth:strategy:)
Creates multi-label classification metrics for classifications and ground truth labels.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    classifications: some Sequence<ClassificationDistribution<Label>>,
    groundTruth: some Sequence<Set<Label>>,
    strategy: MultiLabelClassificationMetrics<Label>.ThresholdSelectionStrategy
) throws
Parameters
classifications
A sequence of classifications.
groundTruth
A sequence of true labels.
strategy
A label confidence threshold selection strategy.
Discussion
The classifications and ground truth sequences are matched element by element in the order they are provided. Both sequences must have the same number of elements.
