Discussion
By default, RealityKit assumes that image samples aren’t in any particular order. If you’re providing the images in order, with adjacent images next to each other, specifying PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.SampleOrdering.sequential for this value may result in better performance.
This setting has no impact on the quality of the produced object.
