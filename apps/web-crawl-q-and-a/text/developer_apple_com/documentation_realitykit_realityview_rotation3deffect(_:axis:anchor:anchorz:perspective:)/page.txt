Instance Method
rotation3DEffect(_:axis:anchor:anchorZ:perspective:)
Rotates this view’s rendered output in three dimensions around the given axis of rotation.

iOS 13.0+

func rotation3DEffect(
    _ angle: Angle,
    axis: (x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, z: CGFloat),
    anchor: UnitPoint = .center,
    anchorZ: CGFloat = 0,
    perspective: CGFloat = 1
) -> some View
Parameters
angle
The angle at which to rotate the view.
axis
The x, y and z elements that specify the axis of rotation.
anchor
The location with a default of UnitPoint/center that defines a point in 3D space about which the rotation is anchored.
anchorZ
The location with a default of 0 that defines a point in 3D space about which the rotation is anchored.
perspective
The relative vanishing point with a default of 1 for this rotation.
Discussion
Use rotation3DEffect(_:axis:anchor:anchorZ:perspective:) to rotate the view in three dimensions around the given axis of rotation, and optionally, position the view at a custom display order and perspective.
In the example below, the text is rotated 45˚ about the y axis, front-most (the default zIndex) and default perspective (1):
Text("Rotation by passing an angle in degrees")
    .rotation3DEffect(.degrees(45), axis: (x: 0.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0))
    .border(Color.gray)
