Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of baseColor to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw that entity’s base color without any shadows, specular highlights, transparency, or reflections.
Here’s how to enable base color visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .baseColor)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```


![A screenshot showing two virtual TVs from an AR app. The TV on the
left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right uses a base color visualization, and appears without
shadows, reflections, transparency, or other effects.
