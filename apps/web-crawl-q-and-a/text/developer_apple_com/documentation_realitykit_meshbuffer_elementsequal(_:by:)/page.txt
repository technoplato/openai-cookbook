Instance Method
elementsEqual(_:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(
    _ other: OtherSequence,
    by areEquivalent: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areEquivalent
A predicate that returns true if its two arguments are equivalent; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if this sequence and other contain equivalent items, using areEquivalent as the equivalence test; otherwise, false.
Overview
At least one of the sequences must be finite.
The predicate must be a equivalence relation over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.
areEquivalent(a, a) is always true. (Reflexivity)
areEquivalent(a, b) implies areEquivalent(b, a). (Symmetry)
If areEquivalent(a, b) and areEquivalent(b, c) are both true, then areEquivalent(a, c) is also true. (Transitivity)
