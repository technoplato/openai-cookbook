Type Property
default
Provides the default behavior to ensure backward compatibility. The default behavior is to perform a compose handoff if the layerId in the playAnimation() call is set to a non-zero value. If the layerId is set to 0 then a snapshot-and-replace (with applyToAllLayers = true) handoff is performed instead.
