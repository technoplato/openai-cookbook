Enumeration
PhotogrammetrySession.Request
An object that configures a photogrammetry session reconstruction request.

enum Request
Overview
Create a PhotogrammetrySession.Request for each 3D object you want to construct from the same set of photographs. You might, for example, create a session with two requests, one to generate a low-resolution preview object in memory, and a second to generate a high-resolution final object saved to the file system.
Before creating an instance of this class, check isSupported to ensure object capture is available on the current device.
For more information on using PhotogrammetrySession, see Creating 3D objects from photographs.
Topics
Creating the Request
init(modelFile: URL)
Creates an instance based on the contents of a USDZ file.
Specifying the Output
case modelFile(url: URL, detail: PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Detail, geometry: PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Geometry?)
An object-creation request saved to a USDZ file or a folder (for OBJ output).
case modelEntity(detail: PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Detail, geometry: PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Geometry?)
An object-creation request stored in-memory for immediate display.
case bounds
An object-creation request that returns a box the same size as the created model.
enum Detail
Supported levels of detail for a request.
Comparing Values
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the enumeration value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two enumeration values aren’t equal.
static func == (PhotogrammetrySession.Request, PhotogrammetrySession.Request) -> Bool
Indicates whether two enumeration values are equal.
Transforming the Created Model
struct Geometry
An object that holds a bounding box and transformation data for a request.
Enumeration Cases
case pointCloud
The raw detected points from the pictures with no polygons connecting them.
case poses
Requests the estimated pose of the camera in each shot (relative to the common estimated coordinate system shared with the .bounds request).
