static func ..< (maximum: Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>
Parameters
maximum
The upper bound for the range.
Discussion
Use the prefix half-open range operator (prefix ..<) to create a partial range of any type that conforms to the Comparable protocol. This example creates a PartialRangeUpTo<Double> instance that includes any value less than 5.0.
let upToFive = ..<5.0


upToFive.contains(3.14)       // true
upToFive.contains(6.28)       // false
upToFive.contains(5.0)        // false
You can use this type of partial range of a collection’s indices to represent the range from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the partial range’s upper bound.
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
print(numbers[..<3])
// Prints "[10, 20, 30]"
Precondition
maximum must compare equal to itself (i.e. cannot be NaN).
