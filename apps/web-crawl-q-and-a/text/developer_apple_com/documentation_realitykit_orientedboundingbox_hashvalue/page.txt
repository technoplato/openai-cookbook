var hashValue: Int { get }
Discussion
Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different executions of your program. Do not save hash values to use during a future execution.
Important
hashValue is deprecated as a Hashable requirement. To conform to Hashable, implement the hash(into:) requirement instead. The compiler provides an implementation for hashValue for you.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
