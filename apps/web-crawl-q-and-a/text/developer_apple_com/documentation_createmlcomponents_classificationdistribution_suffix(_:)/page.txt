func suffix(_ maxLength: Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
maxLength
The maximum number of elements to return. The value of maxLength must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence terminating at the end of the collection with at most maxLength elements.
Discussion
If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result contains all the elements in the collection.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.suffix(2))
// Prints "[4, 5]"
print(numbers.suffix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
