Discussion
You can find an entity by name in a scene by calling the scene’s findEntity(named:) method. Or you can recursively search among the children of a given entity by calling the entity’s findEntity(named:) method.
Entity names are not guaranteed to be unique. When you search by name, these methods return the first entity encountered with the given name.
