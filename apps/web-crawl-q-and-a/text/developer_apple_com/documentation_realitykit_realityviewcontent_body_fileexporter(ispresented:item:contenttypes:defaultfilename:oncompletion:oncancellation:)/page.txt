Presents a system interface allowing the user to export a Transferable item to file on disk.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileExporter<T>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    item: T?,
    contentTypes: [UTType] = [],
    defaultFilename: String? = nil,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<URL, Error>) -> Void,
    onCancellation: @escaping () -> Void = { }
) -> some View where T : Transferable
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the interface should be shown.
item
The item to be saved on disk.
contentTypes
The optional content types to use for the exported file. If empty, SwiftUI uses the content types from the transferRepresentation property provided for Transferable conformance.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has succeeded or failed.
onCancellation
A callback that will be invoked if the operation was cancelled.
Discussion
In order for the interface to appear isPresented must be set to true. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCompletion will not be called.
