Instance Method
starts(with:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func starts<PossiblePrefix>(
    with possiblePrefix: PossiblePrefix,
    by areEquivalent: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where PossiblePrefix : Sequence
Parameters
possiblePrefix
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areEquivalent
A predicate that returns true if its two arguments are equivalent; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements of possiblePrefix; otherwise, false. If possiblePrefix has no elements, the return value is true.
Discussion
The predicate must be a equivalence relation over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
areEquivalent(a, a) is always true. (Reflexivity)
areEquivalent(a, b) implies areEquivalent(b, a). (Symmetry)
If areEquivalent(a, b) and areEquivalent(b, c) are both true, then areEquivalent(a, c) is also true. (Transitivity)
Complexity
O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of possiblePrefix.
