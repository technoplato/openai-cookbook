var rawValue: String
Discussion
A new instance initialized with rawValue will be equivalent to this instance. For example:
enum PaperSize: String {
    case A4, A5, Letter, Legal
}


let selectedSize = PaperSize.Letter
print(selectedSize.rawValue)
// Prints "Letter"


print(selectedSize == PaperSize(rawValue: selectedSize.rawValue)!)
// Prints "true"
