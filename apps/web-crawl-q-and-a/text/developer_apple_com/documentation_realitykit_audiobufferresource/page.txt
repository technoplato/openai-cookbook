class AudioBufferResource
Overview
This class contains in-memory audio data that the framework plays for the app. When your app dictates using text-to-speech, the system provides an audio buffer that the framework plays using this class. You can also load and play arbitrary audio data from disk.
The following code creates an instance of this class and passes in an audio buffer from disk.
// Create a URL for a file name.
let audioFileUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: "testFile.aif")


// Enable spatial playback. var options =
AudioBufferResource.CreateOptions() options.spatialMode = .spatial
options.mixGroupName = "MySpatialMixGroup1"


// Create an audio buffer and load in the file.
let audioFileRead = try AVAudioFile(forReading: audioFileUrl)
let audioFormat = audioFileRead.processingFormat
let audioFrameCount = UInt32(audioFileRead.length)
let audioFileBuffer = AVAudioPCMBuffer(pcmFormat: audioFormat,
    frameCapacity: audioFrameCount)


try audioFileRead.read(into: audioFileBuffer!)


// Create an instance of this class from the audio buffer.
let createdAudioBuffer = try AudioBufferResource(buffer: audioFileBuffer!,
    options: options)
