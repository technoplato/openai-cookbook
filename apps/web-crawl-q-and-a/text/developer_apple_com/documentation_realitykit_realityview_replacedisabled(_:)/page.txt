Instance Method
replaceDisabled(_:)
Prevents replace operations in a text editor.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func replaceDisabled(_ isDisabled: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
isDisabled
A Boolean value that indicates whether text replacement in the find and replace interface is disabled.
Return Value
A view that disables the replace feature of a find and replace interface.
Discussion
Add this modifier to ensure that people can’t activate the replace feature of a find and replace interface for a TextEditor:
TextEditor(text: $text)
    .replaceDisabled()
If you want to disable both find and replace, use the View/findDisabled(_:) modifier instead.
Using this modifer also disables the replace feature of a find and replace interface that you present programmatically using the View/findNavigator(isPresented:) method. Be sure to place the disabling modifier closer to the text editor for this to work:
TextEditor(text: $text)
    .replaceDisabled(isDisabled)
    .findNavigator(isPresented: $isPresented)
If you apply this modifer at multiple levels of a view hierarchy, the call closest to the text editor takes precedence. For example, people can activate find and replace for the first text editor in the following example, but only find for the second:
VStack {
    TextEditor(text: $text1)
        .replaceDisabled(false)
    TextEditor(text: $text2)
}
.replaceDisabled(true)
