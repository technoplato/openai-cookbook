Instance Method
unproject(_:ontoPlane:)
Maps a 2D point from the view’s coordinate system onto the given plane in 3D space.

iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
@MainActor
func unproject(
    _ point: CGPoint,
    ontoPlane planeTransform: float4x4
) -> SIMD3<Float>?
Parameters
point
The point in the view’s coordinate system.
Return Value
The 3D position in world coordinates, or nil if the mapping isn’t possible.
Discussion
planeTransform: A transform used to define the coordinate system of the plane. The positive Y axis is taken as the normal of the plane.
