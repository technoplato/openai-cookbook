Discussion
An entity’s UV texture coordinates control how RealityKit materials map image textures onto an entity. This property allows you to transform the texture coordinates to change the way this material maps its textures. You might, for example, change the scale of a property to apply a tiled, repeating pattern, or continuously rotate or translate the texture coordinates to animate materials to create special effects, such as fire or flowing liquids.
The following example shows how to set a material’s UV transformation:
let rotationRadians = Float(45.0) * .pi / 180 // 45 degrees converted to radians.
material.textureCoordinateTransform = .init(offset: SIMD2<Float>(x:0.5, y: 0.5),
                                            scale: SIMD2<Float>(x:0.5, y: 0.5),
                                            rotation: rotationRadians)
Some entities imported from USDZ files have more than one set of UV coordinates. This property affects the primary UV set (sometimes called “UV1”). To transform the secondary UV coordinates (”UV2”), use secondaryTextureCoordinateTransform.
