MeshJointInfluence
A binding to a joint, which consists of the joint’s index and the weight of that joint’s influence on a vertex.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct MeshJointInfluence
Overview
A vertex may be influenced by one or more joints. The skinned position of that vertex is defined by a set of MeshJointInfluence values whose weights sum to 1. The skinned position is given by:
position = vertexPosition(transformedByJoint: influences[0].jointIndex) * influences[0].weight
         + vertexPosition(transformedByJoint: influences[1].jointIndex) * influences[1].weight
         + ...
The skinned position of a vertex is a linear combination of the vertex’s position transformed by each joint, with weights given by the MeshJointInfluence values.
To transform a vertex position by a joint, the initial vertex position is first transformed by the joint’s inverse bind pose matrix, then by the local-to-parent transform of the joint, and finally by the local-to-parent transform of each of the joint’s parents.
