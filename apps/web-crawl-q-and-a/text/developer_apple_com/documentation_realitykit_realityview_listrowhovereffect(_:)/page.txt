visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func listRowHoverEffect(_ effect: HoverEffect?) -> some View
Parameters
effect
The hover effect applied to the entire list row.
Return Value
A view that requests a hover effect for a containing list row
Discussion
By default, List rows have built-in hover effects in visionOS. In some cases, it is useful to change the default hover effect.
This modifier can be applied to a list row’s content to request that the list row’s default effect be replaced by the provided effect. If the view is not contained within a List or if the view does not support hover effects in this context, the modifier has no effect.
Use a nil effect to indicate that the list row’s default hover effect should not be modified.
