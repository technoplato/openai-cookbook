Concurrency Note
You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration:
class func prepareCustomLanguageModel(for asset: URL, clientIdentifier: String, configuration: SFSpeechLanguageModel.Configuration, ignoresCache: Bool) async throws
For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously.
