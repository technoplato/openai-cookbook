Instance Method
suffix(_:)
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the sequence.
RealityKit

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func suffix(_ maxLength: Int) -> [Self.Element]
Parameters
maxLength
The maximum number of elements to return. The value of maxLength must be greater than or equal to zero.
Overview
The sequence must be finite. If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the sequence, the result contains all the elements in the sequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.suffix(2))
// Prints "[4, 5]"
print(numbers.suffix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

func prefix(Int) -> PrefixSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the sequence.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns a sequence containing the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy the given predicate.
