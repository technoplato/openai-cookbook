struct RenderCallbacks
Overview
Render callbacks are closures RealityKit calls at predefined times. You can use render callbacks to modify the results of RealityKit’s rendering. If you assign a function or closure to any of the contained callback properties, RealityKit calls that function or closure at a predefined time. Setting the postProcess property, for example, causes RealityKit to call the assigned function or closure every frame, after RealityKit renders the scene, but before it displays it.
