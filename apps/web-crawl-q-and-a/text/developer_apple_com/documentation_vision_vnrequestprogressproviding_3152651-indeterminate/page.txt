Instance Property
indeterminate
A Boolean set to true when a request can't determine its progress in fractions completed.

var indeterminate: Bool { get }
Required
Discussion
A value of true doesn't mean that the request will run forever. Rather, it means that the nature of the request can't be broken down into identifiable fractions to report. The progressHandler will still be called at suitable intervals.
