Discussion
With Physically Based Rendering (PBR), you can give entities in RealityKit the appearance of emitting light. Use this property to simulate real-world objects that glow, such as objects with LEDs or computer screens. To enable light emission from a material, set emissiveIntensity to a value greater than zero, then specify a color for the emitted light other than black using this property. You can specify a single emissive color for the entire material, or use a UV-mapped image texture to use different colors for different parts of the entity.
The following example uses a single color for the entire material:
material.emissiveIntensity = 2.0
self.emissiveColor = PhysicallyBasedMaterial.EmissiveColor(color: .red)
This example uses an image map to control the light emission color:
if let emissiveResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:"entity_emissive") {
    let emissiveMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(emissiveResource)
    material.emissiveColor = .init(texture: emissiveMap)
}
