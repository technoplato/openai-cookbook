Discussion
Normal mapping is a real-time rendering technique that captures fine surface details for a model by using a texture instead of increasing the number of polygons in the model. It works by storing surface normals, which are vectors perpendicular to the surface of the model, from a much higher-resolution version of the same 3D object. A normal map stores each vector in the image by storing the vectors’ X, Y, and Z values as the R, G, and B components of the corresponding pixel in the UV-mapped image.
For custom materials, normal is only used when lightingModel is CustomMaterial.LightingModel.lit or CustomMaterial.LightingModel.clearcoat and its surface shader calls params.surface().set_normal(). The normal map texture is still available to your surface shader function when using CustomMaterial.LightingModel.unlit.
The following code loads a normal map texture and uses it to set this property:
if let normalResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:"entity_normals") {
    let normalMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(normalResource)
    material.normal = .init(texture:normalMap)
}
The following Metal code shows how to sample the normal map texture in a surface shader and use it to set the fragment’s surface normal:
    // Retrieve the entity's texture coordinates.
    float2 uv = params.geometry().uv0();


    // Entities loaded from USDZ or .reality files have texture coordinates
    // with a flipped y-axis. This adjusts for that.
    uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;


    // Sample the normal map to get the surface normal for this fragment.
    auto tex = params.textures();
    float3 color = (float3)tex.normal().sample(textureSampler, uv).rgb;


    // Set the fragment's surface normal using the sampled value.
    params.surface().set_normal(color);
