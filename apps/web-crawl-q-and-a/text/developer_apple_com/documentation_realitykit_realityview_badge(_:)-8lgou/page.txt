Parameters
label
An optional string to display as a badge. Set the value to nil to hide the badge.
Discussion
Use a badge to convey optional, supplementary information about a view. Keep the contents of the badge as short as possible. Badges appear only in list rows, tab bars, and menus.
This modifier creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to Text/init(_:)-9d1g4. The following example shows a list with a “Default” badge on one of its rows.
NavigationView {
    List(servers) { server in
        Text(server.name)
            .badge(server.defaultString())
    }
    .navigationTitle("Servers")
}
