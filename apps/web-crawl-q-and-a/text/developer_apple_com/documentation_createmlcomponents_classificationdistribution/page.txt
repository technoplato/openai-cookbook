ClassificationDistribution
A classification distribution that contains a probability for each classification label.

struct ClassificationDistribution<Label> where Label : Hashable
Topics
Creating the Distribution
init<C>(C)
Creates a classification distribution.
Getting the Properties
var endIndex: Int
The index of the final element in the classification distribution.
var labelsSortedByProbability: [Label]
The labels sorted by decreasing probability.
var mostLikelyLabel: Label?
The label with the highest probability.
var startIndex: Int
The index of the initial element in the classification distribution.
Getting the Index
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the index immediately after an element index.
func index(before: Int) -> Int
Returns the index immediately before an element index.
Labeling and Mapping
func topLabels(Int) -> [Label]
Computes the most likely labels in the classification set.
func map<T>((Classification<Label>) throws -> Classification<T>) rethrows -> ClassificationDistribution<T>
Creates a new classification distribution by applying a transformation to every element.
Accessing by Subscript
subscript(Range<Int>) -> Slice<ClassificationDistribution<Label>>
Accesses a contiguous range of elements.
subscript(Int) -> Classification<Label>
Accesses a classification at an index.
subscript(Label) -> Float?
Accesses a probability with label.
Type Aliases
typealias Element
A type representing the sequence’s elements.
typealias Index
A type that represents a position in the collection.
typealias Indices
A type that represents the indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
typealias Iterator
A type that provides the collection’s iteration interface and encapsulates its iteration state.
typealias SubSequence
A collection representing a contiguous subrange of this collection’s elements. The subsequence shares indices with the original collection.
