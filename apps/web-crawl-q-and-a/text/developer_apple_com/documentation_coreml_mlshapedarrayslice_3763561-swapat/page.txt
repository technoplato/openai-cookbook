Instance Method
swapAt(_:_:)
Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
Xcode 13.0+
mutating func swapAt(
    _ i: Int,
    _ j: Int
)
Parameters
i
The index of the first value to swap.
j
The index of the second value to swap.
Discussion
Both parameters must be valid indices of the collection that are not equal to endIndex. Calling swapAt(_:_:) with the same index as both i and j has no effect.
Complexity: O(1)

Modifying a Shaped Array Slice
subscript(Range<Int>) -> MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>
Accesses a slice with a range in the shaped array’s first dimension.
func partition(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int
Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
func sort<Comparator>(using: Comparator)
Reorders a shaped array slice by sorting its slices with a comparator.
func sort<S, Comparator>(using: S)
Reorders a shaped array slice by sorting its slices with a sequence of comparators.
func sort(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool)

func popFirst() -> MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>?
Removes and returns the first element of the collection.
func popLast() -> MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>?
Removes and returns the last element of the collection.
func removeFirst() -> MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>

Reverses the elements of the collection in place.
func shuffle()
Shuffles the collection in place.
func shuffle<T>(using: inout T)
