Instance Method
firstIndex(of:)
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func firstIndex(of element: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
element
An element to search for in the collection.
Return Value
The first index where element is found. If element is not found in the collection, returns nil.
Overview
After using firstIndex(of:) to find the position of a particular element in a collection, you can use it to access the element by subscripting. This example shows how you can modify one of the names in an array of students.
var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime"]
if let i = students.firstIndex(of: "Maxime") {
    students[i] = "Max"
}
print(students)
// Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Max"]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

Manipulating Indices
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
var indices: DefaultIndices<Self>
The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
Available when Indices is DefaultIndices<Self>.
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection. (See Collection.startIndex.)
var endIndex: Int
TThe collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument. (See Collection.endIndex.)
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the position immediately after the given index. (See Collection.index.)
func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
