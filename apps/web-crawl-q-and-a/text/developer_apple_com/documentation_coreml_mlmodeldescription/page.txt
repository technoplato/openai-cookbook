Topics
Accessing Feature Descriptions
var inputDescriptionsByName: [String : MLFeatureDescription]
A dictionary of input feature descriptions, which the model keys by the input’s name.
var outputDescriptionsByName: [String : MLFeatureDescription]
A dictionary of output feature descriptions, which the model keys by the output’s name.
class MLFeatureDescription
The name, type, and constraints of an input or output feature.
Accessing Metadata
var classLabels: [Any]?
An array of labels, which can be either strings or a numbers, for classifier models.
var metadata: [MLModelMetadataKey : Any]
A dictionary of the model’s creation information, such as its description, author, version, and license.
struct MLModelMetadataKey
The set of keys the model uses to store values in its metadata dictionary.
Accessing Prediction Names
var predictedFeatureName: String?
The name of the primary prediction feature output description.
var predictedProbabilitiesName: String?
The name of the feature output description for all probabilities of a prediction.
Accessing Update Descriptions
var isUpdatable: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether you can update the model with additional training.
var trainingInputDescriptionsByName: [String : MLFeatureDescription]
A dictionary of the training input feature descriptions, which the model keys by the input’s name.
var parameterDescriptionsByKey: [MLParameterKey : MLParameterDescription]
A dictionary of the descriptions for the model’s parameters.
class MLParameterDescription
A description of a model parameter that includes a default value and a constraint, if applicable.
