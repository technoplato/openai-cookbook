func fileDialogImportsUnresolvedAliases(_ imports: Bool) -> some View
Parameters
imports
A Boolean value that indicates if the application receives unresolved or resolved URLs when a user chooses aliases.
Discussion
By default, file dialogs resolve aliases and provide the URL of the item referred to by the chosen alias. This modifier allows control of this behavior: pass true if the application doesn’t want file dialog to resolve aliases.
