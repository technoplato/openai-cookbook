class AnchorEntity
Overview
Use anchor entities to control how RealityKit places virtual objects into your scene. AnchorEntity conforms to the HasAnchoring protocol, which gives it an AnchoringComponent instance.
RealityKit places anchors based on the anchoring component’s target property. For example, you can configure an anchor entity to rest on a detected horizontal surface in an AR scene like a table or floor, and RealityKit automatically places that anchor once it detects an appropriate horizontal plane in the real world.
For information on the different types of anchors available when using Reality Composer, see Selecting an Anchor for a Reality Composer Scene.
Add anchor entities directly to your scene’s anchors collection, or anywhere else in the scene hierarchy by adding them to the children collection of another entity in your scene. Because AnchorEntity is a subclass of Entity, you can make an anchor entity a child of any other entity. RealityKit may move anchor entities as the scene updates, so the location and rotation of the anchor entity may change relative to its parent, even if your code never modifies its transform property.
Some anchor entities may not show up in your scene at all if RealityKit fails to detect an appropriate place for them. For example, an anchor entity with an image target won’t show up in the scene until RealityKit detects the specified image in the real world.
You can have multiple anchors in a RealityKit scene. For example, one anchor could place a toy car on a horizontal surface, like a table, and another could tie an informative text bubbles to an image in the same scene.
Topics
Creating an Anchor
init()
Creates a new anchor entity.
init(AnchoringComponent.Target)
convenience init(anchor: ARAnchor)
Creates an anchor entity that uses an existing AR anchor.
convenience init(plane: AnchoringComponent.Target.Alignment, classification: AnchoringComponent.Target.Classification, minimumBounds: SIMD2<Float>)
Creates an anchor entity that targets a plane with the given characteristics.
convenience init(raycastResult: ARRaycastResult)
Creates an anchor entity using the information about a real-world surface discovered using a ray-cast query.
convenience init(world: float4x4)
Creates an anchor entity with a target fixed at the given position in the scene.
convenience init(world: SIMD3<Float>)
Creates an anchor entity with a target fixed at the given position in the scene.
Configuring the Anchor
var anchoring: AnchoringComponent
struct AnchoringComponent
A description of how virtual content can be anchored to the real world.
var anchorIdentifier: UUID?
The identifier of the AR anchor with which the anchor entity is associated, or nil if it isn’t currently anchored.
func reanchor(AnchoringComponent.Target, preservingWorldTransform: Bool)
Changes the entity’s anchoring, preserving either the world transform or the local transform.
protocol HasAnchoring
An interface that enables anchoring of virtual content to a real-world object in an AR scene.
Positioning Entities in Space
API Reference
The Transform Component
Manipulate the scale, rotation, and translation of the entity.
Synchronizing an Entity Among Peers
struct SynchronizationComponent
A component that synchronizes an entity between processes and networked applications.
