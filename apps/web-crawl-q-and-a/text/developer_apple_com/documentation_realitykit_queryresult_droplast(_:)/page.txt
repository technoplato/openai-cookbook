Swift
Instance Method
dropLast(_:)
Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of final elements.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func dropLast(_ k: Int = 1) -> [Self.Element]
Parameters
n
The number of elements to drop off the end of the sequence. n must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A sequence leaving off the specified number of elements.
Discussion
The sequence must be finite. If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the sequence, the result is an empty sequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.dropLast(2))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3]"
print(numbers.dropLast(10))
// Prints "[]"
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
