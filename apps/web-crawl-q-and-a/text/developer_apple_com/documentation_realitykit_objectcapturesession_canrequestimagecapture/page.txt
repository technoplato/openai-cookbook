Instance Property
canRequestImageCapture
Will be true only when a call to requestImageCapture() is expected to be successful. It will be false when not in the .capturing state or if the session is too busy to currently process a new request. There is a period of time after requesting an image capture where this property will be false and a new call to requestImageCapture() will not produce a new image.
