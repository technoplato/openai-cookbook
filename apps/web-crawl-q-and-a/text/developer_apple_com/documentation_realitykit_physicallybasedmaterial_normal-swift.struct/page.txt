struct Normal
Overview
The normal property of a RealityKit entity holds an optional normal map, which stores fine details about the entity’s surface, using a texture rather than increasing the number of polygons in the model. If you provide a normal map, RealityKit uses the vectors from that normal map when rendering the entity, resulting in greater detail and more accurate highlights, shadows, and reflections.
Topics
Creating a Normal Object
init(texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates an object from a specified texture.
init(CustomMaterial.Normal)
Creates a normal object from a custom material’s normal property.
Accessing the Normal Map
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The material’s normal map.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of the object’s texture property.
See Also
Using a Normal Map
var normal: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Normal
The normal map for the entity.
