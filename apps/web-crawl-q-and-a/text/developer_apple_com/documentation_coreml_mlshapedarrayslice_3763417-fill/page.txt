mutating func fill<C>(with collection: C) where C : Collection, Scalar == C.Element
Parameters
collection
A collection of scalar values.
Discussion
The method assigns the shaped array’s elements in first-major order — an equivalent to row-major order for arrays with three or more dimensions. The method repeatedly uses elements in collection, in order, if the shaped array has more elements than collection.
