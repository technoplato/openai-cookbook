Overview
A directional light shines in the entithy’s forward direction (0, 0, -1). To orient a directional light, use HasTransform.look(at:from:upVector:).
A directional light source can cast shadows. To enable shadows, create a DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow and assign it to HasDirectionalLight.shadow. To disable shadows set HasDirectionalLight.shadow to nil.
Topics
Creating a Directional Light
init(color: DirectionalLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, isRealWorldProxy: Bool)
Creates a directional light with the given configuration.
init(color: DirectionalLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, isRealWorldProxy: Bool)
Creates a directional light with the given configuration.
Setting the Color
var color: DirectionalLightComponent.Color
A color for the directional light.
var color: DirectionalLightComponent.Color
A color for the directional light.
typealias Color
A platform-specific type used to define color for a directional light.
Setting Intensity and Shadows
var intensity: Float
The intensity of the directional light, measured in lumen per square meter.
struct Shadow
Defines shadow characteristics for a directional light.
var isRealWorldProxy: Bool
A Boolean that you use to control whether the directional light operates as a proxy for a real-world light.
Registering a Component Type
static func registerComponent()
Registers a new component type.
Comparing Directional Light Components
static func == (DirectionalLightComponent, DirectionalLightComponent) -> Bool
Indicates whether two directional light components are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two directional light components are not equal.
