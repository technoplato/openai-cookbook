Enumeration
ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing
Options for specifying the duration of the particle effects, used by the timing property.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum Timing
Topics
Structures
struct VariableDuration
Duration along with an optional variation used to define an amount of time.
Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing, ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case once(warmUp: TimeInterval?, emit: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration)
Emits for the given emit duration and then stops, warmUp determines how long the simulation should appear to have run before first appearing.
case repeating(warmUp: TimeInterval?, emit: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration, idle: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration?)
Emits for the given emit duration, and waits idle seconds before looping, warmUp determines how long the simulation should appear to have run before first appearing.
Initializers
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
