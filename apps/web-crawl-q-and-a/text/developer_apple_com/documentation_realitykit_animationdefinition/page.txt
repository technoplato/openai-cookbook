protocol AnimationDefinition
Overview
The framework adopts this protocol for several concrete animation objects, such as FromToByAnimation, SampledAnimation, OrbitAnimation, BlendTreeAnimation, AnimationView, and AnimationGroup.
Topics
Configuring the Animation
var name: String
A textual name for the animation.
Required
var bindTarget: BindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
Required
var blendLayer: Int32
The order in which the framework composites the animation.
Required
Timing the Animation
var speed: Float
A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
Required
var delay: TimeInterval
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
Required
var duration: TimeInterval
The total playback time of the animation.
Required
var offset: TimeInterval
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
Required
var trimDuration: TimeInterval?
An optional duration that overrides the source animation’s duration.
Required
var trimStart: TimeInterval?
The time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
Required
var trimEnd: TimeInterval?
The time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.
Required
func trimmed(start: TimeInterval?, end: TimeInterval?, duration: TimeInterval?) -> Self
Edits the animation duration according to the specified time.
Repeating Animation Playback
var repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
Required
var fillMode: AnimationFillMode
An option that determines which data displays outside of the normal duration.
Required
func repeated(count: TimeInterval) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by an irrational number.
func repeated(count: Int) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by a whole number.
func repeatingForever() -> Self
Repeats the animation infinitely.
