Instance Method
prefix(while:)
Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until predicate returns false and skipping the remaining elements.

func prefix(while predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns true if the element should be included or false if it should be excluded. Once the predicate returns false it will not be called again.
Overview
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

Selecting Entities
subscript(Int) -> Entity
Accesses the element at the specified position. (See Collection.subscript.)
func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.
func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.
func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.
func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.
func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
