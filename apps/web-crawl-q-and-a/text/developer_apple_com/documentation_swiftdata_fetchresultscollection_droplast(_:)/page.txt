func dropLast(_ k: Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
k
The number of elements to drop off the end of the collection. k must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence that leaves off k elements from the end.
Discussion
If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result is an empty subsequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.dropLast(2))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3]"
print(numbers.dropLast(10))
// Prints "[]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the number of elements to drop.
