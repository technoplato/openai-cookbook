Enumeration
BlendWeight
A numerical representation of the impact an animation has on a scene or entity.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum BlendWeight
Overview
The BlendTreeSourceNode structure accepts this enumeration as an initializer argument.
To specify a custom weight, use the value case:
let node = BlendTreeSourceNode(
    source: animation1,
    name: "anim2",
    weight: .value(0.75))
Topics
Choosing the Blend Weight
case bindTarget(BindTarget, defaultWeight: Float)
The amount of impact an animation has on the bind target of an entity.
case parameter(String, defaultWeight: Float)
The amount of impact an animation has on a named parameter of an entity.
case value(Float)
The numerical representation of the impact an animation has on an entity.
Comparing Blend Weights
static func == (BlendWeight, BlendWeight) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two blend weights are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two blend weights aren’t equal.
