func accessibilityRotor(
    _ labelKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    textRanges: [Range<String.Index>]
) -> some View
Parameters
labelKey
Localized label identifying this Rotor to the user.
textRanges
An array of ranges that will be used to generate the entries of the Rotor.
Discussion
An Accessibility Rotor is a shortcut for Accessibility users to quickly navigate to specific elements of the user interface, and optionally specific ranges of text within those elements.
In the following example, a Message application adds a Rotor allowing the user to navigate through all the ranges of text containing email addresses.
extension Message {
    // Ranges of special areas in the `content` text. Calculated
    // when `content` is set and then cached so that we don't have
    // to re-compute them.
    var emailAddressRanges: [Range<String.Index>]
}


struct MessageContentView: View {
    TextEditor(.constant(message.content))
        .accessibilityRotor("Email Addresses",
            textRanges: message.emailAddressRanges)
}
