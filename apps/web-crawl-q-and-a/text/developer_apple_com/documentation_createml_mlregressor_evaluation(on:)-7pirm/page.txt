Instance Method
evaluation(on:)
Evaluates the classifier on the provided labeled data.
macOS 10.14–13.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func evaluation(on labeledData: MLDataTable) -> MLRegressorMetrics
Parameters
labeledData
An MLDataTable to evaluate the trained model on.
Return Value
Metrics that describe the maximum error (maximumError) or the average error (rootMeanSquaredError).
Discussion
Evaluation should be done on a testing data set that the model has not seen as part of the training or validation data sets. The data should have feature columns with identical name and type to the training data, as well as a labels column with the same name.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
