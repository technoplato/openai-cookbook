Instance Property
maxCount
The largest number of similar items the model stores for each item.
macOS 10.15+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var maxCount: Int
Discussion
The memory Create ML requires to train this model is proportional to this number. A lower value reduces its demand for memory but decreases the recommender’s accuracy. The default value is 64.

Configuring the Parameters
var algorithm: MLRecommender.ModelAlgorithmType
The algorithm the recommender uses to make recommendations.
var maxSimilarityIterations: Int
The largest number of iterations the recommender uses to build its lookup table.
var threshold: Double
The item confidence value cutoff, below which the recommender omits those items from its recommendations.
var nearestItems: MLDataTable?
A data table that lists each item’s nearest items.
