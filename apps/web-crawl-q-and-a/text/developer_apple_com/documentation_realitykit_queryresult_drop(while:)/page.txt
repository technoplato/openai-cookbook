Instance Method
drop(while:)
Returns a sequence by skipping the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy the given predicate.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func drop(while predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> DropWhileSequence<Self>
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the result.
Return Value
A sequence starting after the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy predicate.
Overview
The following example uses the drop(while:) method to skip over the positive numbers at the beginning of the numbers array. The result begins with the first element of numbers that does not satisfy predicate.
let numbers = [3, 7, 4, -2, 9, -6, 10, 1]
let startingWithNegative = numbers.drop(while: { $0 > 0 })
// startingWithNegative == [-2, 9, -6, 10, 1]
If predicate matches every element in the sequence, the result is an empty sequence.
Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of elements to drop from the beginning of the sequence.
