The number of elements in the collection.

var count: Int { get }
Discussion
To check whether a collection is empty, use its isEmpty property instead of comparing count to zero. Unless the collection guarantees random-access performance, calculating count can be an O(n) operation.
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
