func alignmentGuide(
    _ g: HorizontalAlignment,
    computeValue: @escaping (ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat
) -> some View
Parameters
g
A HorizontalAlignment value at which to base the offset.
computeValue
A closure that returns the offset value to apply to this view.
Return Value
A view modified with respect to its horizontal alignment according to the computation performed in the methodâ€™s closure.
Discussion
Use alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:) to calculate specific offsets to reposition views in relationship to one another. You can return a constant or can use the ViewDimensions argument to the closure to calculate a return value.
In the example below, the HStack is offset by a constant of 50 points to the right of center:
VStack {
    Text("Today's Weather")
        .font(.title)
        .border(.gray)
    HStack {
        Text("ðŸŒ§")
        Text("Rain & Thunderstorms")
        Text("â›ˆ")
    }
    .alignmentGuide(HorizontalAlignment.center) { _ in  50 }
    .border(.gray)
}
.border(.gray)
Changing the alignment of one view may have effects on surrounding views. Here the offset values inside a stack and its contained views is the difference of their absolute offsets.
