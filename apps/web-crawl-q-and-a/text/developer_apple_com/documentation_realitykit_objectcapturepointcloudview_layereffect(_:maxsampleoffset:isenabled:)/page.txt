Instance Method
layerEffect(_:maxSampleOffset:isEnabled:)
Returns a new view that applies shader to self as a filter on the raster layer created from self.

func layerEffect(
    _ shader: Shader,
    maxSampleOffset: CGSize,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply as a layer effect.
maxSampleOffset
If the shader function samples from the layer at locations not equal to the destination position, this value must specify the maximum sampling distance in each axis, for all source pixels.
isEnabled
Whether the effect is enabled or not.
Return Value
A new view that renders self with the shader applied as a distortion effect.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a layer effect it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position,
  SwiftUI::Layer layer, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the destination pixel applied to the shader, and layer is a subregion of the rasterized contents of self. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader.
The SwiftUI::Layer type is defined in the <SwiftUI/SwiftUI.h> header file. It exports a single sample() function that returns a linearly-filtered pixel value from a position in the source content, as a premultiplied RGBA pixel value:
namespace SwiftUI {
  struct Layer {
    half4 sample(float2 position) const;
  };
};
The function should return the color mapping to the destination pixel, typically by sampling one or more pixels from layer at location(s) derived from position and them applying some kind of transformation to produce a new color.
Important
Views backed by AppKit or UIKit views may not render into the filtered layer. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
