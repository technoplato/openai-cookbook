var minimumTextHeight: Float { get set }
Discussion
Specify a floating-point number relative to the image height. For example, to limit recognition to text that’s half of the image height, use 0.5. Increasing the size reduces memory consumption and expedites recognition with the tradeoff of ignoring text smaller than the minimum height. The default value is 1/32, or 0.03125.
