func intersection(_ other: Self) -> Self
Parameters
other
An option set.
Return Value
A new option set with only the elements contained in both this set and other.
Overview
This example uses the intersection(_:) method to limit the available shipping options to what can be used with a PO Box destination.
// Can only ship standard or priority to PO Boxes
let poboxShipping: ShippingOptions = [.standard, .priority]
let memberShipping: ShippingOptions =
        [.standard, .priority, .secondDay]


let availableOptions = memberShipping.intersection(poboxShipping)
print(availableOptions.contains(.priority))
// Prints "true"
print(availableOptions.contains(.secondDay))
// Prints "false"
