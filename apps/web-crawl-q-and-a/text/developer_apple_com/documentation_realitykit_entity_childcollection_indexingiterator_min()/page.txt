Instance Method
min()
Returns the minimum element in the sequence.

@warn_unqualified_access
func min() -> Self.Element?
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
Return Value
The sequence’s minimum element. If the sequence has no elements, returns nil.
Overview
This example finds the smallest value in an array of height measurements.
let heights = [67.5, 65.7, 64.3, 61.1, 58.5, 60.3, 64.9]
let lowestHeight = heights.min()
print(lowestHeight)
// Prints "Optional(58.5)"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func max() -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence.
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
