Topics
Creating the Feature
init(labeledBySubdirectoryNamesAt: URL, type: UTType, continueOnFailure: Bool) throws
Reads training examples from a directory containing files in labeled sub-directories.
init(labeledByNamesAt: URL, separator: Character, index: Int, type: UTType, continueOnFailure: Bool) throws
Reads training examples from a directory containing files having their labels in the name. The name can contain multiple words separated by a separator. So the index tells the position of the label in the file name. Files with incorrect name format are ignored.
Getting the Properties
var endIndex: AnnotatedFiles.Index
The collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
var startIndex: AnnotatedFiles.Index
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection.
Indexing
func index(after: AnnotatedFiles.Index) -> AnnotatedFiles.Index
Returns the position immediately after the given index.
typealias Index
A type that represents a position in the collection.
typealias Element
A type representing the sequence’s elements.
Subscripts
subscript(AnnotatedFiles.Index) -> IndexingIterator<AnnotatedFiles>.Element
Accesses the element at the specified position.
Type Aliases
typealias Indices
A type that represents the indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
typealias Iterator
A type that provides the collection’s iteration interface and encapsulates its iteration state.
typealias SubSequence
A collection representing a contiguous subrange of this collection’s elements. The subsequence shares indices with the original collection.
