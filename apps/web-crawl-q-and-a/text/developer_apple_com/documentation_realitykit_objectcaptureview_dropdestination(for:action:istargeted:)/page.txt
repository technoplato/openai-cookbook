Instance Method

Defines the destination of a drag and drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func dropDestination<T>(
    for payloadType: T.Type = T.self,
    action: @escaping ([T], CGPoint) -> Bool,
    isTargeted: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View where T : Transferable
Parameters
payloadType
The expected type of the dropped models.
action
A closure that takes the dropped content and responds appropriately. The first parameter to action contains the dropped items. The second parameter contains the drop location in this view’s coordinate space. Return true if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return false.
isTargeted
A closure that is called when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The received value is true when the cursor is inside the area, and false when the cursor is outside.
Return Value
A view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified type.
Discussion
The dropped content can be provided as binary data, file URLs, or file promises.
The drop destination is the same size and position as this view.
@State private var isDropTargeted = false


var body: some View {
    Color.pink
        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
        .dropDestination(for: String.self) { receivedTitles, location in
            animateDrop(at: location)
            process(titles: receivedTitles)
        } isTargeted: {
            isDropTargeted = $0
        }
}


func process(titles: [String]) { ... }
func animateDrop(at: CGPoint) { ... }
