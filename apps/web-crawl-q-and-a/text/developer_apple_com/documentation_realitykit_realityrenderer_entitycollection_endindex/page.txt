Instance Property
endIndex
The collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.

var endIndex: Int { get }
Discussion
When you need a range that includes the last element of a collection, use the half-open range operator (..<) with endIndex. The ..< operator creates a range that doesn’t include the upper bound, so it’s always safe to use with endIndex. For example:
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
if let index = numbers.firstIndex(of: 30) {
    print(numbers[index ..< numbers.endIndex])
}
// Prints "[30, 40, 50]"
If the collection is empty, endIndex is equal to startIndex.
