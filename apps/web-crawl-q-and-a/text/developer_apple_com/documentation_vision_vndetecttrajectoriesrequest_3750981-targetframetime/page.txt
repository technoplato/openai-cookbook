Instance Property
targetFrameTime
The requested target frame time for processing trajectory detection.

Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var targetFrameTime: CMTime { get set }
Discussion
Use this property value for real-time processing of frames, which requires execution within a specific amount of time. The request evaluates from frame-to-frame. If processing takes longer than the targeted time for the current frame, it attempts to decrease the overall time by reducing the accuracy (down to a set minimum) for the next frame. If a frame takes less time than the targeted time, the request increases the accuracy (up to a set maximum) of the next frame.
The default value is indefinite, which indicates that accuracy stays at the predefined maximum.
