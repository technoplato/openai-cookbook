Instance Method
removeFromParent(preservingWorldTransform:)
Removes the entity from its current parent or from the scene if it is a root entity.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func removeFromParent(preservingWorldTransform: Bool = false)
Discussion
This method behaves like the setParent(_:preservingWorldTransform:) method with a value of nil for the parent parameter, except that method has no effect on root entities. A root entity is one that is stored in a scene’s anchors collection.
The children collections of any modified parent entities are automatically updated as well.
preservingWorldTransform: A Boolean that you set to true to preserve the entity’s world transform, or false to preserve its relative transform. Use true when you want a model to keep its effective location and size within a scene.
