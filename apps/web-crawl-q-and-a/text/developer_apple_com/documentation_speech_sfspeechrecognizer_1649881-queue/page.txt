Instance Property
queue
The queue on which to execute recognition task handlers and delegate methods.
iOS 10.0+
iPadOS 10.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var queue: OperationQueue { get set }
Discussion
The default value of this property is the app's main queue. Assign a different queue if you want delegate methods and handlers to be executed on a background queue.
The handler you pass to the requestAuthorization(_:) method does not use this queue.
