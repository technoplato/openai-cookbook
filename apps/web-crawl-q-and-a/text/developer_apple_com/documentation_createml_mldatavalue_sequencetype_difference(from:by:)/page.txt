Instance Method
difference(from:by:)
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.

func difference<C>(
    from other: C,
    by areEquivalent: (C.Element, Self.Element) -> Bool
) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element> where C : BidirectionalCollection, Self.Element == C.Element
Parameters
other
The base state.
areEquivalent
A closure that returns a Boolean value indicating whether two elements are equivalent.
Return Value
The difference needed to produce the receiver’s state from the parameter’s state.
Discussion
This function does not infer element moves. If you need to infer moves, call the inferringMoves() method on the resulting difference.
Complexity
Worst case performance is O(n * m), where n is the count of this collection and m is other.count. You can expect faster execution when the collections share many common elements.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
