@MainActor
static func load(
    named name: String,
    in bundle: Bundle? = nil,
    options: TextureResource.CreateOptions
) throws -> TextureResource
Parameters
name
The name of the resource. The file extension is optional.
bundle
The bundle to search for the resource. Use nil to indicate the app’s bundle.
options
Configurable options that affect texture loading.
Return Value
The loaded resource.
Discussion
This method loads the image specified by the URL and creates a texture resource from it. This method blocks until it has loaded the image and created the texture resource. RealityKit automatically creates a resource name for this texture resource based on the name and bundle value.
RealityKit uses the resource name to identify resources, and to match texture resources between networked peers. Specify a unique name for each texture resource you load or generate.
