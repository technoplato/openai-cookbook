Swift
Instance Method
fileExporter(isPresented:documents:contentTypes:onCompletion:onCancellation:)
Presents a system dialog for allowing the user to export a collection of documents that conform to ReferenceFileDocument to files on disk.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileExporter<C>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    documents: C,
    contentTypes: [UTType] = [],
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<[URL], Error>) -> Void,
    onCancellation: @escaping () -> Void = {}
) -> some View where C : Collection, C.Element : ReferenceFileDocument
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the dialog should be shown.
documents
The in-memory documents to export.
contentTypes
The list of supported content types which can be exported. If not provided, ReferenceFileDocument.writableContentTypes are used.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has succeeded or failed. The result indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed.
onCancellation
A callback that will be invoked if the user cancels the operation.
Discussion
In order for the dialog to appear, isPresented must be true. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCancellation will be called.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
