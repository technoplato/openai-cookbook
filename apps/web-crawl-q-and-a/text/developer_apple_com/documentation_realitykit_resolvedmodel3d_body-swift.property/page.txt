Discussion
When you implement a custom view, you must implement a computed body property to provide the content for your view. Return a view that’s composed of built-in views that SwiftUI provides, plus other composite views that you’ve already defined:
struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
For more information about composing views and a view hierarchy, see doc:Declaring-a-Custom-View.
