Discussion
In playgrounds and -Onone builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration): If condition evaluates to false, stop program execution in a debuggable state after printing message.
In -O builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), condition is not evaluated, and there are no effects.
In -Ounchecked builds, condition is not evaluated, but the optimizer may assume that it always evaluates to true. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming error.
