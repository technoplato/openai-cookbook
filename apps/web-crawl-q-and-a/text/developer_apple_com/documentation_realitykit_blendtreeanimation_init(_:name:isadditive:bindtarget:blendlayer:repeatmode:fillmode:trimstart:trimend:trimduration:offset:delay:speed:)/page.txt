Initializer
init(_:name:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)
Creates a unique animation from a combination of other animations in the form of a tree.

iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ root: BlendTreeNode,
    name: String = "",
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimDuration: TimeInterval? = nil,
    offset: TimeInterval = 0,
    delay: TimeInterval = 0,
    speed: Float = 1
)
Parameters
root
The first node in a tree of animations.
name
A textual name for the animation.
isAdditive
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
bindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
blendLayer
The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.
repeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
fillMode
The behavior when the animated property reaches its end value.
trimStart
The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.
trimEnd
The optional time, in seconds, at which the source animation stops.
trimDuration
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
offset
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
delay
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
speed
A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
