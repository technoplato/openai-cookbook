Instance Method
shuffle()
Shuffles the collection in place.

mutating func shuffle()
Discussion
Use the shuffle() method to randomly reorder the elements of an array.
var names = ["Alejandro", "Camila", "Diego", "Luciana", "Luis", "Sofía"]
names.shuffle()
// names == ["Luis", "Camila", "Luciana", "Sofía", "Alejandro", "Diego"]
This method is equivalent to calling shuffle(using:), passing in the system’s default random generator.
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

Modifying a Shaped Array
func swapAt(Int, Int)
Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
func partition(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int
Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
func sort<Comparator>(using: Comparator)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a comparator.
func sort<S, Comparator>(using: S)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a sequence of comparators.
func sort(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool)
Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func reverse()
Reverses the elements of the collection in place.
func shuffle<T>(using: inout T)
Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
func withContiguousMutableStorageIfAvailable<R>((inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>) -> R) -> R?
Executes a closure on the collection’s contiguous storage.
