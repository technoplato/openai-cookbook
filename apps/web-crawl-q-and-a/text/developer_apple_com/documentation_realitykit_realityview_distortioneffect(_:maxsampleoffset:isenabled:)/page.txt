Swift
Instance Method
distortionEffect(_:maxSampleOffset:isEnabled:)
Returns a new view that applies shader to self as a geometric distortion effect on the location of each pixel.

func distortionEffect(
    _ shader: Shader,
    maxSampleOffset: CGSize,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply as a distortion effect.
maxSampleOffset
The maximum distance in each axis between the returned source pixel position and the destination pixel position, for all source pixels.
isEnabled
Whether the effect is enabled or not.
Return Value
A new view that renders self with the shader applied as a distortion effect.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a distortion effect it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] float2 name(float2 position, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the destination pixel applied to the shader. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader. The function should return the user-space coordinates of the corresponding source pixel.
Important
Views backed by AppKit or UIKit views may not render into the filtered layer. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
