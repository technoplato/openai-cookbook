init(
    maximumError: Double,
    rootMeanSquaredError: Double
)
Parameters
maximumError
The maximum error of the model for the training data.
Discussion
You typically don’t initialize metrics directly. Instead you get metrics about your model after training. For example, when you train an MLRegressor, you can look at its trainingMetrics and validationMetrics properties. Additionally, you can check the performance on a test set with the evaluation(on:) method.
rootMeanSquaredError: The root mean squared error of the model for the training data.
Beta Software
