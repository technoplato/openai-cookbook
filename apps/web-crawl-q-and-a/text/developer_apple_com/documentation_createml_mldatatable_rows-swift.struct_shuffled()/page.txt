func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]
Return Value
A shuffled array of this sequence’s elements.
Discussion
For example, you can shuffle the numbers between 0 and 9 by calling the shuffled() method on that range:
let numbers = 0...9
let shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled()
// shuffledNumbers == [1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 0]
This method is equivalent to calling shuffled(using:), passing in the system’s default random generator.
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.
func shuffled<T>(using: inout T) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
