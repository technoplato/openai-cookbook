Initializer
init(floatLiteral:)
Creates an object from a single value.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(floatLiteral value: Float)
Parameters
value
The roughness value.
Discussion
The roughness property represents how much the surface of the entity scatters light it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, while one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.
Use this initializer to create an object to specify the amount of roughness using a single value that applies to the entire material.
