func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Return Value
A random element from the collection. If the collection is empty, the method returns nil.
Discussion
Call randomElement() to select a random element from an array or another collection. This example picks a name at random from an array:
let names = ["Zoey", "Chloe", "Amani", "Amaia"]
let randomName = names.randomElement()!
// randomName == "Amani"
This method is equivalent to calling randomElement(using:), passing in the system’s default random generator.
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
