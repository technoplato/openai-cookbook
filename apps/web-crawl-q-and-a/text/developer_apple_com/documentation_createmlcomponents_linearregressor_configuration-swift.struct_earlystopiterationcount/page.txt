var earlyStopIterationCount: Int
Discussion
The fitted method will stop if no significant progress is made for this many iterations. Significant progress happens when the validation error decreases by at least convergenceThreshold.
Note
Early stopping only happens when using the fitted method with validation data.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
