func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher)
Available when Prediction conforms to Hashable and Annotation conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
hasher
The hasher to use when combining the components of this instance.
Discussion
Implement this method to conform to the Hashable protocol. The components used for hashing must be the same as the components compared in your type’s == operator implementation. Call hasher.combine(_:) with each of these components.
Important
In your implementation of hash(into:), don’t call finalize() on the hasher instance provided, or replace it with a different instance. Doing so may become a compile-time error in the future.
