Overview
Instantiate this handler to perform Vision requests on a single image. You specify the image and, optionally, a completion handler at the time of creation, and call perform(_:) to begin executing the request.
Topics
Creating a Request Handler
init(cgImage: CGImage, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on Core Graphics images.
init(cgImage: CGImage, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on a Core Graphics image with known orientation.
init(ciImage: CIImage, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on CIImage data.
init(ciImage: CIImage, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on CIImage data of a known orientation.
init(cvPixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler for performing requests on a Core Video pixel buffer.
init(cvPixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler for performing requests on a Core Video pixel buffer of a known orientation.
init(cvPixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer, depthData: AVDepthData, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Beta
init(cmSampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a request handler that performs requests on an image contained within a sample buffer.
init(cmSampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a request handler that performs requests on an image of a specified orientation contained within a sample buffer.
init(cmSampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, depthData: AVDepthData, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a request handler that performs requests on an image in a sample buffer that contains depth data.
Beta
init(data: Data, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on an image contained in an NSData object.
init(data: Data, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on an image of known orientation, contained in an NSData object.
init(url: URL, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on an image at the specified URL.
init(url: URL, orientation: CGImagePropertyOrientation, options: [VNImageOption : Any])
Creates a handler to be used for performing requests on an image with known orientation, at the specified URL.
Executing a Request Handler
func perform([VNRequest])
Schedules Vision requests to perform.
Setting Image Options
struct VNImageOption
An option key passed into VNImageRequestHandler creations or requests that take an auxiliary image.
