visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
convenience init(
    named name: String,
    in bundle: Bundle? = nil,
    options: TextureResource.CreateOptions
) async throws
Parameters
name
The name of the resource. The file extension is optional.
bundle
The bundle to search for the resource. Use nil to indicate the app’s bundle.
options
Configuration options for texture creation.
Discussion
RealityKit automatically creates a resource name for the texture resource based on the value of name and bundle. RealityKit uses the resource name to identify resources, and to match texture resources between networked peers. Specify a unique name for each texture resource you load or generate.
