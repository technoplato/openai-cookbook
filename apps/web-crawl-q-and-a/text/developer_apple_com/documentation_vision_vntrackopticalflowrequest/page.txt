Class
VNTrackOpticalFlowRequest
An object that determines the direction change of vectors for each pixel from a previous to current image.

class VNTrackOpticalFlowRequest : VNStatefulRequest
Overview
This request works at the pixel level, so both images must have the same dimensions to successfully perform the request.
Setting a region of interest isolates where to perform the change determination.
Important
Optical flow requests are very resource intensive, so perform only one request at a time. Release memory immediately after generating an optical flow.
Topics
Creating an Optical Flow
init()
Creates a new request that tracks the optical from one image to another.
init(completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)
Creates a new request that tracks the optical from one image to another, with a system callback on completion.
Configuring the Request
var computationAccuracy: VNTrackOpticalFlowRequest.ComputationAccuracy
The level of accuracy to compute the optical flow.
enum VNTrackOpticalFlowRequest.ComputationAccuracy
Computational accuracy options.
var keepNetworkOutput: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates the raw pixel buffer continues to emit from the network.
var outputPixelFormat: OSType
The pixel format type of the output value.
Accessing the Results
var results: [VNPixelBufferObservation]?
The optical flow results the request observes.
