maximumPolygonCount
The upper limit on polygons in the model mesh.

var maximumPolygonCount: UInt
Discussion
Note: this is an upper bound to control the amount of decimation performed on complicated meshes to allow the user to target specific renderer resource budgets, and not a specification for how many polygons to use. Specifically, for less complex models, the actual number of polygons may be significantly less than this value – the algorithm will use as many as it deems necessary (within this limit) to accurately represent the reconstructed model.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
