visionOS 1.0+ Beta
case labeledFiles(at: URL)
Parameters
at
URL: The URL to a folder in the file system that contains audio files. The data source uses the first component of each audio file’s name as its classification label.
Discussion
Create a sound classifier data source from a directory of audio files with the labeledFiles case. You must name each file with a sound classification label, followed by a period and an arbitrary string, ending with the file extension. For example, you can name a sound classifier’s training files as Laughter.3.png, Applause.1.jpg, Applause.2.jpg, and so on.
In this example, these audio file names give a sound classifier at least two class labels:
Laughter
Applause
