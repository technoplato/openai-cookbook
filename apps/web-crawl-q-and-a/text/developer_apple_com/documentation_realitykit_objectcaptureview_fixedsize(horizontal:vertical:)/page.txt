func fixedSize(
    horizontal: Bool,
    vertical: Bool
) -> some View
Parameters
horizontal
A Boolean value that indicates whether to fix the width of the view.
vertical
A Boolean value that indicates whether to fix the height of the view.
Return Value
A view that fixes this view at its ideal size in the dimensions specified by horizontal and vertical.
Discussion
This function behaves like View/fixedSize(), except with fixedSize(horizontal:vertical:) the fixing of the axes can be optionally specified in one or both dimensions. For example, if you horizontally fix a text view before wrapping it in the frame view, you’re telling the text view to maintain its ideal width. The view calculates this to be the space needed to represent the entire string.
Text("A single line of text, too long to fit in a box.")
    .fixedSize(horizontal: true, vertical: false)
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    .border(Color.gray)
This can result in the view exceeding the parent’s bounds, which may or may not be the effect you want.
