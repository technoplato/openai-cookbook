struct SpotLightComponent
Overview
A spot light illuminates a cone-shaped volume in the entity’s forward direction (0, 0, -1) . To orient a spot light, use HasTransform.look(at:from:upVector:).
To enable shadows, create a DirectionalLightComponent.Shadow and assign it to HasDirectionalLight.shadow. To disable shadows set HasDirectionalLight.shadow to nil.

Creating a Spotlight
init(color: SpotLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, innerAngleInDegrees: Float, outerAngleInDegrees: Float, attenuationRadius: Float)
Creates a spotlight with the given parameters.
init(color: SpotLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, innerAngleInDegrees: Float, outerAngleInDegrees: Float, attenuationRadius: Float)
Creates a spotlight with the given parameters.
Setting the Color
var color: SpotLightComponent.Color
A color for the spotlight.
var color: SpotLightComponent.Color
