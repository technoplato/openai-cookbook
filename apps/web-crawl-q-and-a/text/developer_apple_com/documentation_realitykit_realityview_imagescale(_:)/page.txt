func imageScale(_ scale: Image.Scale) -> some View
Parameters
scale
One of the relative sizes provided by the image scale enumeration.
Discussion
The example below shows the relative scaling effect. The system renders the image at a relative size based on the available space and configuration options of the image it is scaling.
VStack {
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
            .imageScale(.small)
        Text("Small")
    }
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
            .imageScale(.medium)
        Text("Medium")
    }


    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
            .imageScale(.large)
        Text("Large")
    }
}
