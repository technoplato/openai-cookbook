Enumeration
MLClassifier
A model you train to classify data into discrete categories.
macOS 10.14+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum MLClassifier
Overview
Use an MLClassifier to train a general-purpose model to recognize categories.
For example, you can create a classifier that predicts whether a sports team is likely to win or lose its next game by training it with these inputs:
The team’s win-loss ratio
The team’s game locations
Important
When working with image or natural language data, don’t use MLClassifier. Instead, use the MLImageClassifierBuilder or one of the Natural Language models (MLTextClassifier or MLWordTagger).
When you create an MLClassifier, Create ML inspects your data and automatically chooses a specific classifier (see Supporting Classifier Types).
Topics
Creating and Training a Classifier
init(trainingData: MLDataTable, targetColumn: String, featureColumns: [String]?) throws
Creates a classifier from the feature columns in the training data to predict the categories in the target column.
var targetColumn: String
The name of the column you selected at initialization to define which categories the classifier predicts.
var featureColumns: [String]
The names of the columns you selected at initialization to train the classifier.
Assessing Model Accuracy
var trainingMetrics: MLClassifierMetrics
Measurements of the classifier’s performance on the training data set.
var validationMetrics: MLClassifierMetrics
Measurements of the classifier’s performance on the validation data set.
Evaluating a Classifier
func evaluation(on: MLDataTable) -> MLClassifierMetrics
Evaluates the classifier on the provided labeled data.
Testing a Classifier
func predictions(from: MLDataTable) throws -> MLUntypedColumn
Classifies the provided data into the target categories.
Saving a Classifier
func write(to: URL, metadata: MLModelMetadata?) throws
Exports a Core ML model file for use in your app.
func write(toFile: String, metadata: MLModelMetadata?) throws
Exports a Core ML model file for use in your app.
Describing a Model
var model: MLModel
The underlying Core ML model stored in memory.
var description: String
A text representation of the classifier.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the classifier that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the classifier shown in a playground.
Classifier Cases
The classifier case that is chosen automatically when you initialize an MLClassifier.
case decisionTree(MLDecisionTreeClassifier)
A classifier that predicts the target by creating rules to split the data.
case randomForest(MLRandomForestClassifier)
A classifier based on a collection of decision trees trained on subsets of the data.
case boostedTree(MLBoostedTreeClassifier)
A classifier based on a collection of decision trees combined with gradient boosting.
case logisticRegression(MLLogisticRegressionClassifier)
A classifier that predicts a discrete target value as a function of data features.
case supportVector(MLSupportVectorClassifier)
A classifier that predicts a binary target value by maximizing the separation between categories.
Supporting Classifier Types
struct MLDecisionTreeClassifier
A classifier that predicts the target by creating rules to split the data.
struct MLRandomForestClassifier
A classifier based on a collection of decision trees trained on subsets of the data.
struct MLBoostedTreeClassifier
A classifier based on a collection of decision trees combined with gradient boosting.
struct MLLogisticRegressionClassifier
A classifier that predicts a discrete target value as a function of data features.
struct MLSupportVectorClassifier
A classifier that predicts a binary target value by maximizing the separation between categories.
Initializers
init(trainingData: DataFrame, targetColumn: String, featureColumns: [String]?) throws
Creates a classifier.
Instance Methods
func evaluation(on: DataFrame) -> MLClassifierMetrics
Evaluates the classifier on the provided labeled data.
func predictions(from: DataFrame) throws -> AnyColumn
