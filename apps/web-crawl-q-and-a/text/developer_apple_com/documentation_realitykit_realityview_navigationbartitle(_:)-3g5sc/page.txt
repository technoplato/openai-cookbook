func navigationBarTitle(_ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey) -> some View
Parameters
titleKey
A key to a localized description of this view to display in the navigation bar.
Discussion
Use navigationBarTitle(_:) to set the title of the navigation bar using a LocalizedStringKey that will be used to search for a matching localized string in the application’s localizable strings assets.
This modifier only takes effect when this view is inside of and visible within a NavigationView.
In the example below, a string constant is used to access a LocalizedStringKey that will be resolved at run time to provide a title for the navigation bar. If the localization key cannot be resolved, the text of the key name will be used as the title text.
struct FlavorView: View {
    let items = ["Chocolate", "Vanilla", "Strawberry", "Mint Chip",
                 "Pistachio"]
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(items, id: \.self) {
                Text($0)
            }
            .navigationBarTitle("Today's Flavors")
        }
    }
}
