Preliminary_Text
A prim that renders 3D text in a scene.
Overview
Because Preliminary_Text prim is an Xformable prim, you define its position either by specifying an offset in world coordinates, or by specifying that the prim should inherit its parent transform.
Alternatively, you can request that the runtime anchor a text prim in the real world by inheriting Preliminary_AnchoringAPI. Many AR experiences include anchored text to add information or context about real-world objects or virtual content.
Declaration
class Preliminary_Text "Preliminary_Text" (
    inherits = </Gprim>
)
Create Single-Line or Flowing Text
The following example demonstrates single-line text.
def Preliminary_Text "heading"
{
    string content = "Units Sold"
    string[] font = [ "Helvetica", "Arial" ]
    token wrapMode = "singleLine"
    token horizontalAlignment = "left"
    token verticalAlignment = "baseline"
}
The following example shows text flowing in a rectangular region, with line breaks as needed.
def Preliminary_Text "sign"
{
    string content = "Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country."
    string[] font = [ "ZapfChancery", "Bradley Hand", "cursive" ]
    token wrapMode = "flowing"
    float width = 120
    float height = 100
    token horizontalAlignment = "center"
    token verticalAlignment = "top"
}
