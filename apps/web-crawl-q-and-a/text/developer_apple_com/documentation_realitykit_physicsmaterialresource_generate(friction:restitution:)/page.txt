@MainActor
static func generate(
    friction: Float = 0.8,
    restitution: Float = 0.8
) -> PhysicsMaterialResource
Parameters
friction
The coefficient of friction, in the range [0, infinity).
restitution
The coefficient of restitution, in the range [0, 1]. Use values at the high end of the range to indicate materials that experience elastic collisions, meaning that objects bounce off each other and kinetic energy is conserved after a collision. Use low values to indicate materials that loose kinetic energy when they collide.
Return Value
A physics material resource.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
