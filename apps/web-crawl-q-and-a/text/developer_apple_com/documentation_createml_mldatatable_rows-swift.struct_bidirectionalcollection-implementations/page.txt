func difference<C>(from: C) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, Self.Element) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.
func dropLast(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence containing all but the specified number of final elements.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func last(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the last element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func lastIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the last index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func lastIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the index of the last element in the collection that matches the given predicate.
func reversed() -> ReversedCollection<Self>
Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.
