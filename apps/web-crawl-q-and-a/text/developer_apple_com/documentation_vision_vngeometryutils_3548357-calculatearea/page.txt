Type Method
calculateArea(_:for:orientedArea:)
Calculates the area for the specified contour.

class func calculateArea(
    _ area: UnsafeMutablePointer<Double>,
    for contour: VNContour,
    orientedArea: Bool
) throws
Parameters
area
The output parameter to populate with the calculated contour area.
contour
The contour object for which to calculate the area.
orientedArea
A Boolean value that indicates whether to calculate the signed area (positive for counterclockwise-oriented contours and negative for clockwise-oriented contours). If you specify false, the returned area is always positive.
Discussion
Attempting to calculate the area for a contour containing random points, or with self-crossing edges, produces undefined results.
