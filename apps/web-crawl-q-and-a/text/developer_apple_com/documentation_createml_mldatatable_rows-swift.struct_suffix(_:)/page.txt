Instance Method
suffix(_:)
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.

func suffix(_ maxLength: Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
maxLength
The maximum number of elements to return. maxLength must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence terminating at the end of the collection with at most maxLength elements.
Discussion
If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result contains the entire collection.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.suffix(2))
// Prints "[4, 5]"
print(numbers.suffix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is equal to maxLength.

func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.
func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.
func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until predicate returns false and skipping the remaining elements.
func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
