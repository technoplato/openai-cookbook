Instance Method
dropFirst(_:)
Returns a sequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func dropFirst(_ k: Int = 1) -> DropFirstSequence<Self>
Parameters
k
The number of elements to drop from the beginning of the sequence. k must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A sequence starting after the specified number of elements.
Discussion
If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the sequence, the result is an empty sequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.dropFirst(2))
// Prints "[3, 4, 5]"
print(numbers.dropFirst(10))
// Prints "[]"
Complexity
O(1), with O(k) deferred to each iteration of the result, where k is the number of elements to drop from the beginning of the sequence.
