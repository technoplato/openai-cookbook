func alert<A, M, T>(
    _ title: Text,
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    presenting data: T?,
    @ViewBuilder actions: (T) -> A,
    @ViewBuilder message: (T) -> M
) -> some View where A : View, M : View
Parameters
title
the title of the alert.
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to false and dismisses.
data
An optional source of truth for the alert. The system passes the contents to the modifier’s closures. You use this data to populate the fields of an alert that you create that the system displays to the user.
actions
A ViewBuilder returning the alert’s actions given the currently available data.
message
A ViewBuilder returning the message for the alert given the currently available data.
Discussion
For the alert to appear, both isPresented must be true and data must not be nil. The data should not change after the presentation occurs. Any changes that you make after the presentation occurs are ignored.
Use this method when you need to populate the fields of an alert with content from a data source. The example below shows a custom data source, SaveDetails, that provides data to populate the alert:
struct SaveDetails: Identifiable {
    let name: String
    let error: String
    let id = UUID()
}


struct SaveButton: View {
    @State private var didError = false
    @State private var details: SaveDetails?
    let alertTitle: String = "Save failed."


    var body: some View {
        Button("Save") {
            details = model.save(didError: $didError)
        }
        .alert(
            Text(alertTitle),
            isPresented: $didError,
            presenting: details
        ) { details in
            Button(role: .destructive) {
                // Handle the deletion.
            } label: {
                Text("Delete \(details.name)")
            }
            Button("Retry") {
                // Handle the retry action.
            }
        } message: { details in
            Text(details.error)
        }
    }
}
All actions in an alert dismiss the alert after the action runs. The default button is shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the KeyboardShortcut/defaultAction keyboard shortcut.
The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.
If no actions are present, the system includes a standard “OK” action. No default cancel action is provided. If you want to show a cancel action, use a button with a role of ButtonRole/cancel.
On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, alerts only support controls with labels that are Text. Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
Only unstyled text is supported for the message.
