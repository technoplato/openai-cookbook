Creating Parameters
init(algorithm: MLRecommender.ModelAlgorithmType, threshold: Double, maxCount: Int, nearestItems: MLDataTable?, maxSimilarityIterations: Int)
Creates a new set of recommender configuration parameters.
enum ModelAlgorithmType
The algorithms a recommender can use to make recommendations.
Configuring the Parameters
var algorithm: MLRecommender.ModelAlgorithmType
The algorithm the recommender uses to make recommendations.
var maxCount: Int
The largest number of similar items the model stores for each item.
var maxSimilarityIterations: Int
The largest number of iterations the recommender uses to build its lookup table.
var threshold: Double
The item confidence value cutoff, below which the recommender omits those items from its recommendations.
var nearestItems: MLDataTable?
A data table that lists each item’s nearest items.
Initializers
init(algorithm: MLRecommender.ModelAlgorithmType, threshold: Double, maxCount: Int, nearestItemsDataFrame: DataFrame?, maxSimilarityIterations: Int)
Creates a new set of recommender configuration parameters.
