Instance Property
hashValue
The hash value.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var hashValue: Int { get }
Overview
Because hash values aren’t always equal across app executions, saving them for future execution isn’t reliable.
Important
hashValue is deprecated as a Hashable requirement. To conform to Hashable, implement the hash(into:) requirement instead.

Comparing Repeat Modes
static func == (AnimationRepeatMode, AnimationRepeatMode) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two repeat modes are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two repeat modes aren’t equal.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of a value by feeding them into the given hasher.
