func refreshable(action: @escaping () async -> Void) -> some View
Parameters
action
An asynchronous handler that SwiftUI executes when the user requests a refresh. Use this handler to initiate an update of model data displayed in the modified view. Use await in front of any asynchronous calls inside the handler.
Return Value
A view with a new refresh action in its environment.
Discussion
Apply this modifier to a view to set the EnvironmentValues/refresh value in the view’s environment to a RefreshAction instance that uses the specified action as its handler. Views that detect the presence of the instance can change their appearance to provide a way for the user to execute the handler.
For example, when you apply this modifier on iOS and iPadOS to a List, the list enables a standard pull-to-refresh gesture that refreshes the list contents. When the user drags the top of the scrollable area downward, the view reveals a progress indicator and executes the specified handler. The indicator remains visible for the duration of the refresh, which runs asynchronously:
List(mailbox.conversations) { conversation in
    ConversationCell(conversation)
}
.refreshable {
    await mailbox.fetch()
}
You can add refresh capability to your own views as well. For information on how to do that, see RefreshAction.
