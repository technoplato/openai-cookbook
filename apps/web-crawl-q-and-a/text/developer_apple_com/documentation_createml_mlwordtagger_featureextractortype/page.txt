Selecting a Feature Extractor Type
case dynamicEmbedding
A feature extractor that provides embeddings for words, based on their in-context use.
Describing a Feature Extractor Type
var description: String
A text representation of a feature extractor type.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the feature extractor that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the feature extractor in a playground.
Comparing Feature Extractors
static func == (MLWordTagger.FeatureExtractorType, MLWordTagger.FeatureExtractorType) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Enumeration Cases
case bertEmbedding
A feature extractor that provides BERT contextual word embeddings.
Beta
case elmoEmbedding
