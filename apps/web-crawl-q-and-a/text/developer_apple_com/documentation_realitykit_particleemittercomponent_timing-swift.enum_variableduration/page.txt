Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration, ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init(duration: TimeInterval, variation: TimeInterval?)
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
let duration: TimeInterval
Base duration of time.
let variation: TimeInterval?
Defines a plus/minus range from which a value is randomly selected and used to offset duration.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
