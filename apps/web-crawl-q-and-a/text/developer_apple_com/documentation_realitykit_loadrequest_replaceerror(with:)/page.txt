func replaceError(with output: Self.Output) -> Publishers.ReplaceError<Self>
Parameters
output
An element to emit when the upstream publisher fails.
Return Value
A publisher that replaces an error from the upstream publisher with the provided output element.
Discussion
If the upstream publisher fails with an error, this publisher emits the provided element, then finishes normally.
In the example below, a publisher of strings fails with a MyError instance, which sends a failure completion downstream. The Publisher/replaceError(with:) operator handles the failure by publishing the string (replacement element) and completing normally.
struct MyError: Error {}
let fail = Fail<String, MyError>(error: MyError())
cancellable = fail
    .replaceError(with: "(replacement element)")
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("\($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print ("\($0)", terminator: " ") }
    )


// Prints: "(replacement element) finished".
This Publisher/replaceError(with:) functionality is useful when you want to handle an error by sending a single replacement element and end the stream. Use Publisher/catch(_:) to recover from an error and provide a replacement publisher to continue providing elements to the downstream subscriber.
