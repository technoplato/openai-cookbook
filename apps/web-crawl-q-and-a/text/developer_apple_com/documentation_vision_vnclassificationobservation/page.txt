class VNClassificationObservation : VNObservation
Overview
This type of observation results from performing a VNCoreMLRequest image analysis with a Core ML model whose role is classification (rather than prediction or image-to-image processing). Vision infers that an MLModel object is a classifier model if that model predicts a single feature. That is, the model’s modelDescription object has a non-nil value for its predictedFeatureName property.
Topics
Determining Classification
var identifier: String
Classification label identifying the type of observation.
Measuring Confidence and Precision
var hasPrecisionRecallCurve: Bool
A Boolean variable indicating whether the observation contains precision and recall curves.
func hasMinimumPrecision(Float, forRecall: Float) -> Bool
Determines whether the observation for a specific recall has a minimum precision value.
func hasMinimumRecall(Float, forPrecision: Float) -> Bool
Determines whether the observation for a specific precision has a minimum recall value.
