ModelDebugOptionsComponent.VisualizationMode.lightingSpecular

Discussion
Adding a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of lightingSpecular to an entity tells RealityKit to draw the intensity of direct light falling on the entity as its surface color. The calculated value represents direct light hitting the object from both real-world and virtual lights. RealityKit draws the light intensity as a grayscale value from black (0.0) to white (1.0).
RealityKit calculates specular lighting for entities with a SimpleMaterial and for entities imported from a USDZ file. For other entities, this option has no effect.
Here’s how to enable roughness visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .lightingSpecular)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```


![A screenshot showing two virtual TVs from an AR app. The TV on the
left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right is drawn in shades of gray, which is a representation of
the amount of direct light falling on the TV at each
point.](ModelDebugOptionsComponent-VisualizationMode-swift-enum-lightingSpecular-1)
