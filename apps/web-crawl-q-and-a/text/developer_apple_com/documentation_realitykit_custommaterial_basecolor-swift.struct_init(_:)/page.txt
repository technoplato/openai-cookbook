Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a custom base color object from an existing physically based material’s base color object.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(_ value: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.BaseColor)
Parameters
value
The base color object from a physically based material.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create a CustomMaterial.BaseColor that contains the same tint and texture values as an existing PhysicallyBasedMaterial.BaseColor object.
Both tint and texture from the PhysicallyBasedMaterial.BaseColor object are available in your surface shader, but RealityKit doesn’t automatically use those values to render the entity. Your surface shader must calculate the final base color value for each pixel and assign it by calling params.surface().set_base_color().
For more information on creating custom materials and writing shader functions, see Modifying RealityKit Rendering Using Custom Materials.
