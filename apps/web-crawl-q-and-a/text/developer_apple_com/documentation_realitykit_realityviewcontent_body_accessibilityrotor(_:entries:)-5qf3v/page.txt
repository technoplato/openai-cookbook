    @AccessibilityRotorContentBuilder entries: @escaping () -> Content
) -> some View where L : StringProtocol, Content : AccessibilityRotorContent
Parameters

Localized label identifying this Rotor to the user.
entries
Content used to generate Rotor entries. This can include AccessibilityRotorEntry structs, as well as constructs such as if and ForEach.
Discussion
An Accessibility Rotor is a shortcut for Accessibility users to quickly navigate to specific elements of the user interface, and optionally specific ranges of text within those elements.
In the following example, a Message application creates a Rotor allowing users to navigate to specifically the messages originating from VIPs.
// `messages` is a list of `Identifiable` `Message`s.


ScrollView {
    LazyVStack {
        ForEach(messages) { message in
            MessageView(message)
        }
    }
}
.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)
.accessibilityRotor("VIPs") {
    // Not all the MessageViews are generated at once, the model
    // knows about all the messages.
    ForEach(messages) { message in
        // If the Message is from a VIP, make a Rotor entry for it.
        if message.isVIP {
            AccessibilityRotorEntry(message.subject, id: message.id)
        }
    }
}
