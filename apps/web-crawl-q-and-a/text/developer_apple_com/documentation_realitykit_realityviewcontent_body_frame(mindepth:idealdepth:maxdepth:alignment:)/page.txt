Instance Method
frame(minDepth:idealDepth:maxDepth:alignment:)
Positions this view within an invisible frame having the specified depth constraints.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func frame(
    minDepth: CGFloat? = nil,
    idealDepth: CGFloat? = nil,
    maxDepth: CGFloat? = nil,
    alignment: DepthAlignment = .center
) -> some View
Parameters
minDepth
The minimum depth of the resulting frame.
idealDepth
The ideal depth of the resulting frame.
maxDepth
The maximum depth of the resulting frame.
alignment
The alignment of this view inside the resulting frame. Note that most alignment values have no apparent effect when the size of the frame happens to match that of this view.
Return Value
A view with flexible dimensions given by the call’s non-nil parameters.
Discussion
Always specify at least one size characteristic when calling this method. Pass nil or leave out a characteristic to indicate that the frame should adopt this view’s sizing behavior, constrained by the other non-nil arguments.
The size proposed to this view is the size proposed to the frame, limited by any constraints specified, and with an ideal dimension specified replacing any corresponding unspecified dimensions in the proposal.
If no minimum or maximum constraint is specified in a given dimension, the frame adopts the sizing behavior of its child in that dimension. If both constraints are specified in a dimension, the frame unconditionally adopts the size proposed for it, clamped to the constraints. Otherwise, the size of the frame in either dimension is:
If a minimum constraint is specified and the size proposed for the frame by the parent is less than the size of this view, the proposed size, clamped to that minimum.
If a maximum constraint is specified and the size proposed for the frame by the parent is greater than the size of this view, the proposed size, clamped to that maximum.
Otherwise, the size of this view.
