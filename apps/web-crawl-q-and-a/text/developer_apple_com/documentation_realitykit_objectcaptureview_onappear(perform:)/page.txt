func onAppear(perform action: (() -> Void)? = nil) -> some View
Parameters
action
The action to perform. If action is nil, the call has no effect.
Return Value
A view that triggers action before it appears.
Discussion
The exact moment that SwiftUI calls this method depends on the specific view type that you apply it to, but the action closure completes before the first rendered frame appears.
