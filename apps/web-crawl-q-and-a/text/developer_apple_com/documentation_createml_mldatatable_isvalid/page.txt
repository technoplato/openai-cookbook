Discussion
Check isValid after you create or mutate a data table to ensure the data table is still valid. If it’s false, the data table encountered an error and you can’t use it for training or subsequent operations. The following are some of the actions that can invalidate a data table:
Adding a column with the name of a column that already exists in the data table - Adding an invalid column - Appending another data table with different column names - Appending another data table with different column types (for a given column name)
