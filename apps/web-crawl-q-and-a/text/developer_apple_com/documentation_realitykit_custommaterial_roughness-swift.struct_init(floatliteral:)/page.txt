Initializer
init(floatLiteral:)
Creates an object to specify the amount of roughness, using a single value that applies to the entire material.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(floatLiteral value: Float)
Parameters
value
The roughness value.
Discussion
The roughness property represents how much the surface of the entity scatters light that it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, and one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.
The following Swift code shows how to specify roughness using a single value for the entire entity:
material.roughness = PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Roughness(floatLiteral: 0.0)
With custom materials, the roughness value is available in your surface shader; however, RealityKit doesn’t use it automatically to render the entity. To render an entity with roughness, the material’s lightingModel must be CustomMaterial.LightingModel.lit or CustomMaterial.LightingModel.clearcoat and the custom material’s surface shader function must call params.surface().set_roughness().
The following Metal code shows how to retrieve the roughness value set using this initializer in your surface shader:
    // Retrieve the roughness scale from the CustomMaterial.
    float roughnessScale = params.material_constants().roughness_scale();


    // Set the roughness value using the roughness scale.
    params.surface().set_roughness(roughnessScale);
For more information on creating custom materials and writing shader functions, see Modifying RealityKit Rendering Using Custom Materials.
