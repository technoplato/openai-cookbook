func minimumScaleFactor(_ factor: CGFloat) -> some View
Parameters
factor
A fraction between 0 and 1 (inclusive) you use to specify the minimum amount of text scaling that this view permits.
Return Value
A view that limits the amount of text downscaling.
Discussion
Use the minimumScaleFactor(_:) modifier if the text you place in a view doesn’t fit and it’s okay if the text shrinks to accommodate. For example, a label with a minimum scale factor of 0.5 draws its text in a font size as small as half of the actual font if needed.
In the example below, the HStack contains a Text label with a line limit of 1, that is next to a TextField. To allow the label to fit into the available space, the minimumScaleFactor(_:) modifier shrinks the text as needed to fit into the available space.
HStack {
    Text("This is a long label that will be scaled to fit:")
        .lineLimit(1)
        .minimumScaleFactor(0.5)
    TextField("My Long Text Field", text: $myTextField)
}
