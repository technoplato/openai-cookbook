autoPlay
Metadata that specifies whether an animation plays automatically on load.
Overview
Set the autoPlay metadata on the document’s stage, that is, the outermost container for scene description. For more information about setting stage metadata, see UsdStage > Stage Metadata.
Set a value of true to play an animation automatically when the scene loads. If this property is false, the animation won’t play on load. If an asset omits the autoPlay property, the animation plays on load for backward-compatibility.
To support assets that disable autoPlay, an app should provide a way to start the animation. For example, when an asset sets autoPlay to false, AR Quick Look displays a scrubber and a Play button the user can tap to start the animation.
Reality Composer sets this property to false when it exports a USDZ to enforce that only behaviors (Preliminary_Behavior) drive animations.
Declaration
bool autoPlay
Disable Automatic Animation Playback
The following asset demonstrates autoPlay alongside existing animation properties, like startTimeCode and endTimeCode. Because this asset defines autoPlay as false, the runtime doesn’t automatically play the animation after it loads this asset.
#usda 1.0
(
    endTimeCode = 300
    startTimeCode = 1
    timeCodesPerSecond = 30
    autoPlay = false
    upAxis = "Y"
)


def Xform "AnimatedModel"
{
    def Xform "body"
    {
        double3 xformOp:translate.timeSamples = { ... }
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]
        ...
    }
    ...
}
