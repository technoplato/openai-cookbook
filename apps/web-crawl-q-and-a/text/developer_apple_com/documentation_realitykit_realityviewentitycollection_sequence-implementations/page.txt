Sequence Implementations
Topics
Instance Properties
var lazy: LazySequence<Self>
A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as map and filter, are implemented lazily.
var publisher: Publishers.Sequence<Self, Never>
Instance Methods
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
If lhs is ordered before rhs in the ordering described by the given sequence of SortComparators
func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence<Self>
Returns a sequence of pairs (n, x), where n represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and x represents an element of the sequence.
func filter(Predicate<Self.Element>) throws -> [Self.Element]
Beta
func filter((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns an array containing, in order, the elements of the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> SegmentOfResult) rethrows -> [SegmentOfResult.Element]
Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func forEach((Self.Element) throws -> Void) rethrows
Calls the given closure on each element in the sequence in the same order as a for-in loop.
func formatted<S>(S) -> S.FormatOutput
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
func map<T>((Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) throws -> ()) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reversed() -> [Self.Element]
Returns an array containing the elements of this sequence in reverse order.
func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
func shuffled<T>(using: inout T) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
func sorted(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func sorted<Comparator>(using: Comparator) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given comparator to compare elements.
func sorted<S, Comparator>(using: S) -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given array of SortComparators to compare elements.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func withContiguousStorageIfAvailable<R>((UnsafeBufferPointer<Self.Element>) throws -> R) rethrows -> R?
Executes a closure on the sequence’s contiguous storage.
