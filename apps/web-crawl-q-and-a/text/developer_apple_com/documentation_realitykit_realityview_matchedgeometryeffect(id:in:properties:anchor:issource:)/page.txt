Instance Method
matchedGeometryEffect(id:in:properties:anchor:isSource:)
Defines a group of views with synchronized geometry using an identifier and namespace that you provide.

func matchedGeometryEffect<ID>(
    id: ID,
    in namespace: Namespace.ID,
    properties: MatchedGeometryProperties = .frame,
    anchor: UnitPoint = .center,
    isSource: Bool = true
) -> some View where ID : Hashable
Parameters
id
The identifier, often derived from the identifier of the data being displayed by the view.
namespace
The namespace in which defines the id. New namespaces are created by adding an @Namespace variable to a View type and reading its value in the view’s body method.
properties
The properties to copy from the source view.
anchor
The relative location in the view used to produce its shared position value.
isSource
True if the view should be used as the source of geometry for other views in the group.
Return Value
A new view that defines an entry in the global database of views synchronizing their geometry.
Discussion
This method sets the geometry of each view in the group from the inserted view with isSource = true (known as the “source” view), updating the values marked by properties.
If inserting a view in the same transaction that another view with the same key is removed, the system will interpolate their frame rectangles in window space to make it appear that there is a single view moving from its old position to its new position. The usual transition mechanisms define how each of the two views is rendered during the transition (e.g. fade in/out, scale, etc), the matchedGeometryEffect() modifier only arranges for the geometry of the views to be linked, not their rendering.
If the number of currently-inserted views in the group with isSource = true is not exactly one results are undefined, due to it not being clear which is the source view.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
