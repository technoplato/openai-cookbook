func saturation(_ amount: Double) -> some View
Parameters
amount
The amount of saturation to apply to this view.
Return Value
A view that adjusts the saturation of this view.
Discussion
Use color saturation to increase or decrease the intensity of colors in a view.
The example below shows a series of red squares with their saturation increasing from 0 (gray) to 100% (fully-red) in 20% increments:
struct Saturation: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(0..<6) {
                Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60, alignment: .center)
                    .saturation(Double($0) * 0.2)
                    .overlay(Text("\(Double($0) * 0.2 * 100, specifier: "%.0f")%"),
                             alignment: .bottom)
                    .border(Color.gray)
            }
        }
    }
}
