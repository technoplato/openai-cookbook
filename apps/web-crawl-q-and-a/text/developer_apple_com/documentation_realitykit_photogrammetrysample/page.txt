PhotogrammetrySample
An object that represents one image and its corresponding metadata.

iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
struct PhotogrammetrySample
Overview
This object holds a single input image for constructing 3D objects from a series of photographs, along with the image’s metadata, such as EXIF data or information about a depth buffer, an object mask, or gravity vector.
Use a unique id for each PhotogrammetrySession so RealityKit can distinguish different PhotogrammetrySample instances in status updates, error messages, and other contexts.
