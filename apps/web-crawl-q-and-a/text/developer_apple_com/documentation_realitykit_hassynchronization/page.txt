Protocol
HasSynchronization
An interface that enables an entity to be synchronized between processes and networked applications.

protocol HasSynchronization : Entity
Overview
All entities automatically adopt this protocol because the Entity base class does. This adoption gives all entities a SynchronizationComponent instance, and a collection of methods for manipulating the component, that you use to manage ownership of the entity.
Topics
Accessing the Component
var synchronization: SynchronizationComponent?
The entity’s synchronization component.
struct SynchronizationComponent
A component that synchronizes an entity between processes and networked applications.
Managing Ownership
var isOwner: Bool
A Boolean that indicates whether the calling process owns the entity.
func requestOwnership(timeout: TimeInterval, (SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferCompletionResult) -> Void)
Requests ownership of the entity.
Making Local Changes
func withUnsynchronized(() -> Void)
Calls the given closure in a way such that component changes that the closure makes don’t trigger synchronization.
