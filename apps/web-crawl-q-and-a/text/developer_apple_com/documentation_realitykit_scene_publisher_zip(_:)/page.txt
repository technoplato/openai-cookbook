Parameters
other
Another publisher.
Return Value
A publisher that emits pairs of elements from the upstream publishers as tuples.
Discussion
Use zip(_:) to combine the latest elements from two publishers and emit a tuple to the downstream. The returned publisher waits until both publishers have emitted an event, then delivers the oldest unconsumed event from each publisher together as a tuple to the subscriber.
Much like a zipper or zip fastener on a piece of clothing pulls together rows of teeth to link the two sides, zip(_:) combines streams from two different publishers by linking pairs of elements from each side.
In this example, numbers and letters are PassthroughSubjects that emit values; once zip(_:) receives one value from each, it publishes the pair as a tuple to the downstream subscriber. It then waits for the next pair of values.
 let numbersPub = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
 let lettersPub = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()


 cancellable = numbersPub
     .zip(lettersPub)
     .sink { print("\($0)") }
 numbersPub.send(1)    // numbersPub: 1      lettersPub:        zip output: <none>
 numbersPub.send(2)    // numbersPub: 1,2    lettersPub:        zip output: <none>
 letters.send("A")     // numbers: 1,2       letters:"A"        zip output: <none>
 numbers.send(3)       // numbers: 1,2,3     letters:           zip output: (1,"A")
 letters.send("B")     // numbers: 1,2,3     letters: "B"       zip output: (2,"B")


 // Prints:
 //  (1, "A")
 //  (2, "B")
If either upstream publisher finishes successfully or fails with an error, the zipped publisher does the same.
