Documentation

Initializer
init(locale:)
Creates a speech recognizer associated with the specified locale.
iOS 10.0+
iPadOS 10.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init?(locale: Locale)
Parameters
locale
The locale object representing the language you want to use for speech recognition. For a list of languages supported by the speech recognizer, see supportedLocales().
Return Value
An initialized speech recognizer object, or nil if the specified language was not supported.
Discussion
If you specify a language that is not supported by the speech recognizer, this method attempts to fall back to the language used by the keyboard for dictation. If that fails, this method returns nil.
Even if this method returns a valid speech recognizer object, the speech recognition services may be temporarily unavailable. To determine whether speech recognition services are available, check the isAvailable property.
