The reflectiveness value for the material.
Discussion
In PBR rendering, the metallic property represents the reflectiveness of an entity. This initializer creates a new object from a single value to describe the reflectiveness of the entire material. A value of 0.0 creates a dielectric (or non-reflective) material. Values greater than 0.0 result in an increasingly metallic (or reflective) materials.
