Collection Implementations
Topics
Instance Properties
var count: Int
The number of elements in the collection.
var first: Self.Element?
The first element of the collection.
var isEmpty: Bool
A Boolean value indicating whether the collection is empty.
var underestimatedCount: Int
A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the collection.
Instance Methods
func drop(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence by skipping elements while predicate returns true and returning the remaining elements.
func dropFirst(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence containing all but the given number of initial elements.
func firstIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func firstRange<C>(of: C) -> Range<Self.Index>?
Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given collection within this collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func makeIterator() -> IndexingIterator<Self>
Returns an iterator over the elements of the collection.
Available when Iterator is IndexingIterator<Self>.
func map<T>((Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func prefix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.
func prefix(through: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection through the specified position.
func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until predicate returns false and skipping the remaining elements.
func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection.
func randomElement<T>(using: inout T) -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
func ranges<C>(of: C) -> [Range<Self.Index>]
Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence within the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.SubSequence]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate.
func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [Self.SubSequence]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, around elements equal to the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
func trimmingPrefix<Prefix>(Prefix) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a new collection of the same type by removing initial elements that satisfy the given predicate from the start.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func trimmingPrefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
