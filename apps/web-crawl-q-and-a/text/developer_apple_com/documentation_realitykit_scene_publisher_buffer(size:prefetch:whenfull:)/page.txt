func buffer(
    size: Int,
    prefetch: Publishers.PrefetchStrategy,
    whenFull: Publishers.BufferingStrategy<Self.Failure>
) -> Publishers.Buffer<Self>
Parameters
size
The maximum number of elements to store.
prefetch
The strategy to initially populate the buffer.
whenFull
The action to take when the buffer becomes full.
Return Value
A publisher that buffers elements received from an upstream publisher.
Discussion
Use buffer(size:prefetch:whenFull:) to collect a specific number of elements from an upstream publisher before republishing them to the downstream subscriber according to the Publishers/BufferingStrategy and Publishers/PrefetchStrategy strategy you specify.
If the publisher completes before reaching the size threshold, it buffers the elements and publishes them downstream prior to completion.
Beta Software
