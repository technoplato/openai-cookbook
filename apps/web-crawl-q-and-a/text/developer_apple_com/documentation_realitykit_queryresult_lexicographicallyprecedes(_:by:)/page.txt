Swift
Instance Method
lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(
    _ other: OtherSequence,
    by areInIncreasingOrder: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, Self.Element == OtherSequence.Element
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areInIncreasingOrder
A predicate that returns true if its first argument should be ordered before its second argument; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if this sequence precedes other in a dictionary ordering as ordered by areInIncreasingOrder; otherwise, false.
Discussion
The predicate must be a strict weak ordering over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
areInIncreasingOrder(a, a) is always false. (Irreflexivity)
If areInIncreasingOrder(a, b) and areInIncreasingOrder(b, c) are both true, then areInIncreasingOrder(a, c) is also true. (Transitive comparability)
Two elements are incomparable if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If a and b are incomparable, and b and c are incomparable, then a and c are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)
Note
This method implements the mathematical notion of lexicographical ordering, which has no connection to Unicode. If you are sorting strings to present to the end user, use String APIs that perform localized comparison instead.
Complexity
O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
