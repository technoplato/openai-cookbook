func allowsTightening(_ flag: Bool) -> some View
Parameters
flag
A Boolean value that indicates whether the space between characters compresses when necessary.
Return Value
A view that can compress the space between characters when necessary to fit text in a line.
Discussion
Use allowsTightening(_:) to enable the compression of inter-character spacing of text in a view to try to fit the text in the view’s bounds.
In the example below, two identically configured text views show the effects of allowsTightening(_:) on the compression of the spacing between characters:
VStack {
    Text("This is a wide text element")
        .font(.body)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 50, alignment: .leading)
        .lineLimit(1)
        .allowsTightening(true)


    Text("This is a wide text element")
        .font(.body)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 50, alignment: .leading)
        .lineLimit(1)
        .allowsTightening(false)
}
