Structure
PhysicallyBasedMaterial.EmissiveColor
An object that defines the color of the light an entity emits.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct EmissiveColor
Overview
With physically based rendering (PBR), you can give entities in RealityKit the appearance of emitting light. Define the color of the light the entity emits by using this object.
Topics
Creating an Emissive Color Object
init(color: UIColor, texture: MaterialParameters.Texture?)
Creates a color of emitted light in iOS.
init(color: NSColor, texture: MaterialParameters.Texture?)
Creates a color of emitted light in iOS.
init(CustomMaterial.EmissiveColor)
Creates a color of emitted light from a custom material’s emissive color property.
Accessing Texture Data
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
An optional image texture that defines the color of light emission.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of the object’s texture property.
Instance Properties
var color: UIColor
var color: NSColor
See Also
Adding Light Emission
var emissiveIntensity: Float
The intensity of light emitted by the entity.
var emissiveColor: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.EmissiveColor
The color of the light the entity emits.
