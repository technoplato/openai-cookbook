class var weights: MLParameterKey { get }
Discussion
The value type for the weights key is an MLMultiArray. You must scope this key with the name of the specific neural network layer whose weights you’d like to access. See scoped(to:).
Note
You can only override the weights of a model’s updatable layers. Model developers mark these layers as updatable with the Core ML Tools.
