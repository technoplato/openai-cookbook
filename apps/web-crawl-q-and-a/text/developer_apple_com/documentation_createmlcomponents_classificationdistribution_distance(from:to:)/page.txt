func distance(
    from start: Self.Index,
    to end: Self.Index
) -> Int
Parameters
start
A valid index of the collection.
end
Another valid index of the collection. If end is equal to start, the result is zero.
Return Value
The distance between start and end. The result can be negative only if the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol.
Discussion
Unless the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol, start must be less than or equal to end.
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the resulting distance.
