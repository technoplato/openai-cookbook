Discussion
The following example uses the Material/thick material as the sheet background:
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false


    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView()
                .presentationBackground(.thickMaterial)
        }
    }
}
The presentationBackground(_:) modifier differs from the View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:) modifier in several key ways. A presentation background:
Automatically fills the entire presentation.
Allows views behind the presentation to show through translucent styles.
