Class
VNSequenceRequestHandler
An object that processes image analysis requests for each frame in a sequence.
iOS 11.0+
iPadOS 11.0+
macOS 10.13+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
tvOS 11.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
class VNSequenceRequestHandler : NSObject
Overview
Instantiate this handler to perform Vision requests on a series of images. Unlike the VNImageRequestHandler, you don’t specify the image on creation. Instead, you supply each image frame one by one as you continue to call one of the perform methods.
Topics
Initializing a Sequence Request
init()
Initializes a sequence request handler.
