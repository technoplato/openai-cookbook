Overview
Scaling an image ensures that it fits within the algorithm’s input image dimensions, which may require a change in aspect ratio. The figure below shows how each crop-and-scale option transforms the input image:
Topics
Crop and Scale Options
case centerCrop
An option that scales the image to fit its shorter side within the input dimensions, while preserving its aspect ratio, and center-crops the image.
case scaleFit
An option that scales the image to fit its longer side within the input dimensions, while preserving its aspect ratio, and center-crops the image.
case scaleFill
An option that scales the image to fill the input dimensions, resizing it if necessary.
case scaleFitRotate90CCW
An option that rotates the image 90 degrees counterclockwise and then scales it, while preserving its aspect ratio, to fit on the long side.
case scaleFillRotate90CCW
An option that rotates the image 90 degrees counterclockwise and then scales it to fill the input dimensions.
