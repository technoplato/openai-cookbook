func fullScreenCover<Item, Content>(
    item: Binding<Item?>,
    onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Item) -> Content
) -> some View where Item : Identifiable, Content : View
Parameters
item
A binding to an optional source of truth for the sheet. When item is non-nil, the system passes the contents to the modifier’s closure. You display this content in a sheet that you create that the system displays to the user. If item changes, the system dismisses the currently displayed sheet and replaces it with a new one using the same process.
onDismiss
The closure to execute when dismissing the modal view.
content
A closure returning the content of the modal view.
Discussion
Use this method to display a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible. In the example below a custom structure — CoverData — provides data for the full-screen view to display in the content closure when the user clicks or taps the “Present Full-Screen Cover With Data” button:
struct FullScreenCoverItemOnDismissContent: View {
    @State private var coverData: CoverData?


    var body: some View {
        Button("Present Full-Screen Cover With Data") {
            coverData = CoverData(body: "Custom Data")
        }
        .fullScreenCover(item: $coverData,
                         onDismiss: didDismiss) { details in
            VStack(spacing: 20) {
                Text("\(details.body)")
            }
            .onTapGesture {
                coverData = nil
            }
        }
    }


    func didDismiss() {
        // Handle the dismissing action.
    }


}


struct CoverData: Identifiable {
    var id: String {
        return body
    }
    let body: String
}
