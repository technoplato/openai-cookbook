Instance Property
frames
An array of floating-point pairs in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var frames: [SIMD2<Float>] { get set }
Available when Value is SIMD2<Float>.
Discussion
This array contains sequential values for the animated property when bindTarget is an array of simd floating-point pairs.
