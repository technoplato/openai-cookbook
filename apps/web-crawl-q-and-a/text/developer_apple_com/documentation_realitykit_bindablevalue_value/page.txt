var value: T { get set }
Discussion
This property returns the animated value (animatedValue) if an animation is active. Otherwise, this property returns the base value (baseValue).
When you assign a value to this property, the setter always assigns the value you provide to baseValue.
See Also
Accessing the Value
var baseValue: T
A value that reflects the state of the animated property before or after an animation.
var animatedValue: T?
A value that represents the state of the animated property as an animation progresses.
