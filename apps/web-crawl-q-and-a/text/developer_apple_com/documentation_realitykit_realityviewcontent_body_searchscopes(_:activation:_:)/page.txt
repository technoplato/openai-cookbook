func searchScopes<V, S>(
    _ scope: Binding<V>,
    activation: SearchScopeActivation,
    @ViewBuilder _ scopes: () -> S
) -> some View where V : Hashable, S : View
Parameters
scope
The active scope of the search field.
activation
The activation style of the search field’s scopes.
scopes
A view builder that represents the scoping options SwiftUI uses to populate a Picker.
Discussion
To enable people to narrow the scope of their searches, you can create a type that represents the possible scopes, and then create a state variable to hold the current selection. For example, you can scope the product search to just fruits or just vegetables:
enum ProductScope {
    case fruit
    case vegetable
}


@State private var scope: ProductScope = .fruit
Provide a binding to the scope, as well as a view that represents each scope:
ProductList()
    .searchable(text: $text, tokens: $tokens) { token in
        switch token {
        case .apple: Text("Apple")
        case .pear: Text("Pear")
        case .banana: Text("Banana")
        }
    }
    .searchScopes($scope) {
        Text("Fruit").tag(ProductScope.fruit)
        Text("Vegetable").tag(ProductScope.vegetable)
    }
SwiftUI uses this binding and view to add a Picker below the search field. In iOS, macOS, and tvOS, the picker appears below the search field when search is active. To ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type of the scope binding with the type of each view’s tag. Then condition your search on the current value of the scope state property.
By default, the appearance of scopes varies by platform:
In iOS and iPadOS, search scopes appear when someone enters text into the search field and disappear when someone cancels the search.
In macOS, search scopes appear when SwiftUI presents search and disappear when someone cancels the search.
However, you can use the activation parameter with a value of SearchScopeActivation/onTextEntry or SearchScopeActivation/onSearchPresentation to configure this behavior:
.searchScopes($scope, activation: .onSearchPresentation) {
    Text("Fruit").tag(ProductScope.fruit)
    Text("Vegetable").tag(ProductScope.vegetable)
}
