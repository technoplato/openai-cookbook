func border<S>(
    _ content: S,
    width: CGFloat = 1
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
content
A value that conforms to the ShapeStyle protocol, like a Color or HierarchicalShapeStyle, that SwiftUI uses to fill the border.
width
The thickness of the border. The default is 1 pixel.
Return Value
A view that adds a border with the specified style and width to this view.
Discussion
Use this modifier to draw a border of a specified width around the view’s frame. By default, the border appears inside the bounds of this view. For example, you can add a four-point wide border covers the text:
Text("Purple border inside the view bounds.")
    .border(Color.purple, width: 4)
To place a border around the outside of this view, apply padding of the same width before adding the border:
Text("Purple border outside the view bounds.")
    .padding(4)
    .border(Color.purple, width: 4)
