Type Method
loadAsync(named:in:)
Loads a texture resource from a bundle asynchronously.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
static func loadAsync(
    named name: String,
    in bundle: Bundle? = nil
) -> LoadRequest<TextureResource>
Parameters
name
The name of the resource. The file extension is optional.
bundle
The bundle to search for the resource. Use nil to indicate the app’s bundle.
Return Value
A load operation that publishes the resource.
Discussion
RealityKit automatically creates a resource name for the texture resource based on the value of name and bundle. RealityKit uses the resource name to identify resources, and to match texture resources between networked peers. Specify a unique name for each texture resource you load or generate.
