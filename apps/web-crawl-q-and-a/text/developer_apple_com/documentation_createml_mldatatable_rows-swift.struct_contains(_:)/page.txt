func contains(_ element: Self.Element) -> Bool
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
element
The element to find in the sequence.
Return Value
true if the element was found in the sequence; otherwise, false.
Discussion
This example checks to see whether a favorite actor is in an array storing a movie’s cast.
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
print(cast.contains("Marlon"))
// Prints "true"
print(cast.contains("James"))
// Prints "false"
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
