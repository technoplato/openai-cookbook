Type Method
generateConvex(from:)
Creates a convex shape from the given mesh.

iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
nonisolated static func generateConvex(from mesh: MeshResource) async throws -> ShapeResource
Return Value
The new shape, defined by the convex hull of the vertices in mesh.
Discussion
mesh: A mesh with the shape of the convex polyhedron. Use meshes with a small number of vertices to avoid hurting performance.
Throws
Will throw an error if mesh does not define a nonempty convex volume. For example, will fail if all the vertices in mesh are coplanar.
