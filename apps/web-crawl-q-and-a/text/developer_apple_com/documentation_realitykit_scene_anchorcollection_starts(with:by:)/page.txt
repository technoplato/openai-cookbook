Instance Method
starts(with:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func starts<PossiblePrefix>(
    with possiblePrefix: PossiblePrefix,
    by areEquivalent: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where PossiblePrefix : Sequence
Parameters
possiblePrefix
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areEquivalent
A predicate that returns true if its two arguments are equivalent; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements of possiblePrefix; otherwise, false. If possiblePrefix has no elements, the return value is true.
Overview
The predicate must be a equivalence relation over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of possiblePrefix.
areEquivalent(a, a) is always true. (Reflexivity)
areEquivalent(a, b) implies areEquivalent(b, a). (Symmetry)
If areEquivalent(a, b) and areEquivalent(b, c) are both true, then areEquivalent(a, c) is also true. (Transitivity)

Comparing Collections
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
