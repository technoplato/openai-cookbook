func speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation(_ value: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
value
A Boolean value that you set to true if VoiceOver should speak all punctuation in the text. Defaults to true.
Discussion
Use this modifier to control whether the system speaks punctuation characters in the text. You might use this for code or other text where the punctuation is relevant, or where you want VoiceOver to speak a verbatim transcription of the text you provide. For example, given the text:
Text("All the world's a stage, " +
     "And all the men and women merely players;")
     .speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation()
VoiceOver would speak “All the world apostrophe s a stage comma and all the men and women merely players semicolon”.
By default, VoiceOver voices punctuation based on surrounding context.
