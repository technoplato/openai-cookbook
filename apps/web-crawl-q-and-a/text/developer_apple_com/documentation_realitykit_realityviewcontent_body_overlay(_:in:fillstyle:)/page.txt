func overlay<S, T>(
    _ style: S,
    in shape: T,
    fillStyle: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle, T : Shape
Parameters
style
A ShapeStyle that SwiftUI uses to the fill the shape that you specify.
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to Shape that SwiftUI draws in front of the view.
fillStyle
The FillStyle to use when drawing the shape. The default style uses the nonzero winding number rule and antialiasing.
Return Value
A view with the specified shape drawn in front of it.
Discussion
Use this modifier to layer a type that conforms to the Shape protocol — like a Rectangle, Circle, or Capsule — in front of a view. Specify a ShapeStyle that’s used to fill the shape. For example, you can overlay the outline of one rectangle in front of another:
Rectangle()
    .frame(width: 200, height: 100)
    .overlay(.teal, in: Rectangle().inset(by: 10).stroke(lineWidth: 5))
The example above uses the InsettableShape/inset(by:) method to slightly reduce the size of the overlaid rectangle, and the Shape/stroke(lineWidth:) method to fill only the shape’s outline. This creates an inset border:
This modifier is a convenience method for layering a shape over a view. To handle the more general case of overlaying a View — or a stack of views — with control over the position, use View/overlay(alignment:content:) instead. To cover a view with a ShapeStyle, use View/overlay(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:).
