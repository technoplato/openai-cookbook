func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher)
Parameters
hasher
The hasher to use when combining the components of this instance.
Discussion
Implement this method to conform to the Hashable protocol. The components used for hashing must be the same as the components compared in your type’s == operator implementation. Call hasher.combine(_:) with each of these components.
Important
In your implementation of hash(into:), don’t call finalize() on the hasher instance provided, or replace it with a different instance. Doing so may become a compile-time error in the future.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
