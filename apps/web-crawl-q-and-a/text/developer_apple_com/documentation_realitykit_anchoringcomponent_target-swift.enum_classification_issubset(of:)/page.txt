func isSubset(of other: Self) -> Bool
Parameters
other
A set of the same type as the current set.
Return Value
true if the set is a subset of other; otherwise, false.
Overview
Set A is a subset of another set B if every member of A is also a member of B.
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let attendees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Diana"]
print(attendees.isSubset(of: employees))
// Prints "true"
