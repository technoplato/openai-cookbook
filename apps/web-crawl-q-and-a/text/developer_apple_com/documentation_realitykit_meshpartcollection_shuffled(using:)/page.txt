Instance Method
shuffled(using:)
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.

func shuffled<T>(using generator: inout T) -> [Self.Element] where T : RandomNumberGenerator
Parameters
generator
The random number generator to use when shuffling the sequence.
Return Value
An array of this sequence’s elements in a shuffled order.
Overview
You use this method to randomize the elements of a sequence when you are using a custom random number generator. For example, you can shuffle the numbers between 0 and 9 by calling the shuffled(using:) method on that range:
let numbers = 0...9
let shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled(using: &myGenerator)
// shuffledNumbers == [8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 0, 5, 1]
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
Note
The algorithm used to shuffle a sequence may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same shuffled order each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
