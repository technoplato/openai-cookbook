func mapLabels<T>(_ transform: (Label) throws -> T) rethrows -> ClassificationMetrics<T> where T : Hashable
Discussion
The transformation can combine separate labels into one. The metrics will be adjusted accordingly by combining counts from the original labels. An example of this is combining mixed cased labels into lowercase:
let metrics = ClassificationMetrics(predicted, groundTruth).map({ $0.lowercased() })
