protocol MLCustomLayer
Overview
You use the MLCustomLayer protocol to define the behavior of your own neural network layers in Core ML models. You can deploy novel or proprietary models on your own release schedule. Custom layers also provide a mechanism for pre- or post-processing during model evaluation.
Topics
Creating a Layer
init(parameters: [String : Any])
Initializes the custom layer implementation.
Required
Integrating a Layer
func setWeightData([Data])
Assigns the weights for the connections within the layer.
Required
func outputShapes(forInputShapes: [[NSNumber]]) -> [[NSNumber]]
Calculates the shapes of the output of this layer for the given input shapes.
Required
Evaluating a Layer
func evaluate(inputs: [MLMultiArray], outputs: [MLMultiArray])
Evaluates the custom layer with the given inputs.
Required
func encode(commandBuffer: MTLCommandBuffer, inputs: [MTLTexture], outputs: [MTLTexture])
Encodes GPU commands to evaluate the custom layer.
