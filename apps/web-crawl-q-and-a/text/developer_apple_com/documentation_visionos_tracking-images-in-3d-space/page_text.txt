Tracking preregistered images in 3D space
Place content based on the current position of a known image in a person’s surroundings.
Overview
Use ARKit’s support for tracking 2D images to place 3D content in a space. ARKit provides updates to the image’s location as it moves relative to the person. If you supply one or more reference images in your app’s asset catalog, people can use a real-world copy of that image to place virtual 3D content in your app. For example, if you design a pack of custom playing cards and provide those assets to people in the form of a real-world deck of playing cards, they can place unique content per card in a fully immersive experience.
The following example tracks a set of images loaded from an app’s asset catalog:
let session = ARKitSession()
let imageInfo = ImageTrackingProvider(
    referenceImages: ReferenceImage.loadReferenceImages(inGroupNamed: "playingcard-photos")
)


if ImageTrackingProvider.isSupported {
    Task {
        try await session.run([imageInfo])
        for await update in imageInfo.anchorUpdates {
            updateImage(update.anchor)
        }
    }
}


func updateImage(_ anchor: ImageAnchor) {
    if imageAnchors[anchor.id] == nil {
        // Add a new entity to represent this image.
        let entity = ModelEntity(mesh: .generateSphere(radius: 0.05))
        entityMap[anchor.id] = entity
        rootEntity.addChild(entity)
    }
    
    if anchor.isTracked {
        entityMap[anchor.id]?.transform = Transform(matrix: anchor.transform)
    }
}
If you know the real-world dimensions of the images you’re tracking, use the physicalSize property to improve tracking accuracy. The estimatedScaleFactor property provides information about how the scale of the tracked image differs from the expected physical size you provide.
