The directory that imagesDirectory points to must be an empty and writable directory or it is an error. Likewise, if checkpointDirectory is provided, it must be empty if it already exists. If the directory does not exist, it will be created for you. If it cannot be, the session moves to .failed state.
This call is only valid once on a newly created session.
