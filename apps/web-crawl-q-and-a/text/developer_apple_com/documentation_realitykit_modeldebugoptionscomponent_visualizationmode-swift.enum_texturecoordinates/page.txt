Discussion
Adding a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of textureCoordinates to an entity tells RealityKit to draw that entity’s UV texture coordinates as its surface color. RealityKit draws the texture coordinates by using its U and V values as the R and G components of the color, using a value of 0 for the color’s B component.
RealityKit calculates texture coordinates for entities with a VideoMaterial, UnlitMaterial, SimpleMaterial as well as for entities imported from a USDZ file. If an entity doesn’t fall within those parameters, this option has no effect on the rendering.
Here’s how to enable UV texture coordinate visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .textureCoordinates)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```

left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right uses a texture coordinate visualization, and appears in
bright shades of yellow, green, and red, which is a graphical
representation of the TV’s texture coordinates.
