Discussion
After capturing one side of an object, the session can be paused and the user can be prompted to flip the object to a new side (e.g. the bottom showing) and then beginNewScanPassAfterFlip() called. This will transition the session back to the .ready state waiting for a new bounding box selection phase to ensure the correct object is captured. Since the object has been flipped, the miniview capture display in the ObjectCaptureViewwill begin empty after this call.
All captured images are written to the same output directories and the reconstruction process in PhotogrammetrySession will stitch these multiple captures together automatically.
Note: beginNewScanPassAfterFlip() should be called after the object flipped for best results.
See also beginNewScanPass() for the case where the object was not flipped but another capture circle at a different height will be performed on the same side instead.
