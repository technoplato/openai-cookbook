Initializer
init(scale:texture:)
Creates a roughness object from a color or texture.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    scale: Float = 1.0,
    texture: CustomMaterial.Texture? = nil
)
Parameters
scale
The roughness value.
texture
An optional image texture.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create an object to specify the amount of roughness using a single value or an image texture, or both.
The roughness property represents how much the surface of the entity scatters light that it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, and one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.
The following code demonstrates creating a roughness object using this initalizer:
if let roughnessResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_roughness") {
    let roughness = MaterialParameters.Texture(roughnessResource)
    customMaterial.roughness = .init(scale: 0.5, texture: roughness)
}
With custom materials, the texture and scale properties you set on the roughness property are available in your surface shader function, but RealityKit doesn’t automatically use them to render your entity. To render an entity with roughness, lightingModel must be CustomMaterial.LightingModel.lit or CustomMaterial.LightingModel.clearcoat and its surface shader must call params.surface().set_roughness().
To achieve the same metallic behavior as PhysicallyBasedMaterial, the surface shader function multiplies the roughness scale by the sampled value from the roughness texture, as the following Metal code demonstrates:
    // Retrieve the roughness scale from the CustomMaterial.
    float roughnessScale = params.material_constants().roughness_scale();


    // Retrieve the entity's UV texture coordinates.
    float2 uv = params.geometry().uv0();


    // Models loaded from USDZ or Reality Composer use UVs that are flipped
    // on the y-axis. This compensates for that.
    uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;


    // Sample the texture based on the resulting UVs.
    auto tex = params.textures();
    half roughness = tex.roughness().sample(textureSampler, uv).r;


    // Multiply the scale and the sampled value from the texture, and assign
    // the result to the shader's base color property.
    roughness *= roughnessScale;


    // Set the roughness value to be used by the custom material shader.
    params.surface().set_roughness(roughness);
