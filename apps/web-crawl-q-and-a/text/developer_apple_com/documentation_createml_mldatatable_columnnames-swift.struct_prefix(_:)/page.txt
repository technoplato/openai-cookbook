func prefix(_ maxLength: Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
maxLength
The maximum number of elements to return. maxLength must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence starting at the beginning of this collection with at most maxLength elements.
Discussion
If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result contains all the elements in the collection.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.prefix(2))
// Prints "[1, 2]"
print(numbers.prefix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the number of elements to select from the beginning of the collection.
