Swift
Instance Method
index(_:offsetBy:)
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func index(
    _ i: Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int
) -> Self.Index
Parameters
i
A valid index of the collection.
distance
The distance to offset i. distance must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol.
Return Value
An index offset by distance from the index i. If distance is positive, this is the same value as the result of distance calls to index(after:). If distance is negative, this is the same value as the result of abs(distance) calls to index(before:).
Overview
The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from a string’s starting index and then prints the character at that position.
let s = "Swift"
let i = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
print(s[i])
// Prints "t"
The value passed as distance must not offset i beyond the bounds of the collection.
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the absolute value of distance.

Manipulating Indices
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
var indices: DefaultIndices<Self>
The indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.
Available when Indices is DefaultIndices<Self>.
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first element in a nonempty collection. (See Collection.startIndex.)
var endIndex: Int
TThe collection’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument. (See Collection.endIndex.)
func firstIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func firstIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the position immediately after the given index. (See Collection.index.)
func index(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
