static func ..< (minimum: Self, maximum: Self) -> Range<Self>
Parameters
minimum
The lower bound for the range.
maximum
The upper bound for the range.
Discussion
Use the half-open range operator (..<) to create a range of any type that conforms to the Comparable protocol. This example creates a Range<Double> from zero up to, but not including, 5.0.
let lessThanFive = 0.0..<5.0
print(lessThanFive.contains(3.14))  // Prints "true"
print(lessThanFive.contains(5.0))   // Prints "false"
Precondition
minimum <= maximum.
