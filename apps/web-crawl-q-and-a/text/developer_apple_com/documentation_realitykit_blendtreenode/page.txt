Protocol
BlendTreeNode
An interface for a node that’s a member of a blend tree.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
protocol BlendTreeNode
Overview
This protocol specifies the common functionality for the animations that compose a BlendTreeAnimation. The animation defines a root node of this type. To define the tree, you assign the root node one of the follow structures that adopt this protocol:
BlendTreeBlendNode, which branches the tree for every element in sources.
BlendTreeSourceNode, which defines an animation to blend with its source property.
Note
A node in the tree may be of type BlendTreeInvalidNode, which neither specifies a list of sources nor an animation.
Each node type supplies a name and weight, which you can set during or after initialization.
let animation1 = FromToByAnimation(...)


let blendNode = BlendTreeSourceNode(
    source: animation1,
    name: "Anim1",
    weight: .value(0.25))
Topics
Configuring the Blend Tree Node
var name: String
A textual name for the blend node.
Required
var weight: BlendWeight
A normalized percentage that designates how much effect this node has relative to peer nodes.
Required
Blending Animations
func blend(sources: [BlendTreeNode], name: String, isAdditive: Bool) -> BlendTreeNode
Combines the animations that result from the individual blend-tree nodes of the given array to a single blend-tree node.
func blend(BlendTreeNode, BlendTreeNode, name: String, isAdditive: Bool) -> BlendTreeNode
Combines the animations that result from two blend-tree nodes into a single blend-tree node.
