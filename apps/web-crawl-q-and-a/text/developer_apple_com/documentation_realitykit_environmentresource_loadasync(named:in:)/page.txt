@MainActor
static func loadAsync(
    named name: String,
    in bundle: Bundle? = nil
) -> LoadRequest<EnvironmentResource>
Deprecated

Parameters
name
The image name without the file extension.
bundle
The bundle to search for the resource. Use nil to indicate the app’s bundle.
Return Value
The environment resource loaded from the specified bundle.
Discussion
If your image file is at the path Foo.skybox/Bar.exr in your Xcode project, use Bar for the name parameter. This function must be called with the async keyword from an asynchronous context, such as from within a doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/task> closure.
To add an environment resource to your Xcode project, see realitykit/environmentresource.
