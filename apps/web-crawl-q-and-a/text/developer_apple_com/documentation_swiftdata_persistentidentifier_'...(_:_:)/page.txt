static func ... (minimum: Self, maximum: Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>
Parameters
minimum
The lower bound for the range.
maximum
The upper bound for the range.
Discussion
Use the closed range operator (...) to create a closed range of any type that conforms to the Comparable protocol. This example creates a ClosedRange<Character> from “a” up to, and including, “z”.
let lowercase = "a"..."z"
print(lowercase.contains("z"))
// Prints "true"
Precondition
minimum <= maximum.
