func drop<P>(untilOutputFrom publisher: P) -> Publishers.DropUntilOutput<Self, P> where P : Publisher, Self.Failure == P.Failure
Parameters
publisher
A publisher to monitor for its first emitted element.
Return Value
A publisher that drops elements from the upstream publisher until the other publisher produces a value.
Discussion
Use Publisher/drop(untilOutputFrom:) to ignore elements from the upstream publisher until another, second, publisher delivers its first element. This publisher requests a single value from the second publisher, and it ignores (drops) all elements from the upstream publisher until the second publisher produces a value. After the second publisher produces an element, Publisher/drop(untilOutputFrom:) cancels its subscription to the second publisher, and allows events from the upstream publisher to pass through.
After this publisher receives a subscription from the upstream publisher, it passes through backpressure requests from downstream to the upstream publisher. If the upstream publisher acts on those requests before the other publisher produces an item, this publisher drops the elements it receives from the upstream publisher.
In the example below, the pub1 publisher defers publishing its elements until the pub2 publisher delivers its first element:
let upstream = PassthroughSubject<Int,Never>()
let second = PassthroughSubject<String,Never>()
cancellable = upstream
    .drop(untilOutputFrom: second)
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


upstream.send(1)
upstream.send(2)
second.send("A")
upstream.send(3)
upstream.send(4)
// Prints "3 4"
