func listSectionSpacing(_ spacing: CGFloat) -> some View
Parameters
spacing
the amount of spacing to apply.
Discussion
The following example creates a List with 5 pts of spacing between sections:
List {
    Section("Colors") {
        Text("Blue")
        Text("Red")
    }


    Section("Shapes") {
        Text("Square")
        Text("Circle")
    }
}
.listSectionSpacing(5.0)
Spacing can also be specified on a per-section basis. The following example creates a List with compact spacing for its second section:
List {
    Section("Colors") {
        Text("Blue")
        Text("Red")
    }


    Section("Borders") {
        Text("Dashed")
        Text("Solid")
    }
    .listSectionSpacing(.compact)


    Section("Shapes") {
        Text("Square")
        Text("Circle")
    }
}
If adjacent sections have different spacing value, the smaller value on the shared edge is used. Spacing specified inside the List is preferred over any List-wide value.
