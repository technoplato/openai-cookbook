visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func frame(
    depth: CGFloat?,
    alignment: DepthAlignment = .center
) -> some View
Parameters
depth
A fixed depth for the resulting view. If depth is nil, the resulting view assumes this view’s sizing behavior.
alignment
The alignment of this view inside the resulting view. alignment applies if this view is smaller than the size given by the resulting frame.
Return Value
A view with a fixed dimension of depth if non-nil.
Discussion
Use this method to specify a fixed size for a view’s depth. If you don’t specify a dimension, the resulting view assumes this view’s sizing behavior in depth.
