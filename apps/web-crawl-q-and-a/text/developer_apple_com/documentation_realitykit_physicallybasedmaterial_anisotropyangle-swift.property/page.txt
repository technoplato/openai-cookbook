Discussion
This property controls the scattering angle for anisotropic objects. If anisotropyLevel is 0.0, this property has no effect. This property takes a value between 0.0 and 1.0 or a UV-mapped grayscale image specifying angles for different parts of the entity. A value of black (0.0) means a rotation of 0° and a value of white (1.0) indicates a rotation of 360°. To determine the anisotropyAngle value from an angle, divide the desired angle in degrees by 360.0 or the desired angle in radians by pi times 2.
let angleDegrees = Float(125.0)
let anisotropyAngleFromDegrees = angleDegrees / 360.0


let angleRadians = Float(2.181662) let anisotropyAngleFromRadians =
angleRadians / (Float.pi * Float(2.0))
The following example shows how to specify anisotropyAngle using single values for the entire material:
material.anisotropyAngle = .AnisotropyAngle(floatLiteral: 0.25)
This example shows how to specify anisotropy using a UV-mapped image texture for anisotropyLevel and a separate image for anisotropyAngle:
if let anisoLevelResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_aniso_level") {
    let anisoLevelMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(sheenResource)
    material.anisotropyLevel = .init(texture: anisoLevelMap)
}
if let anisoAngleResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_aniso_angle") {
    let anisoAngleMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(anisoAngleResource)
    material.anisotropyAngle = .init(texture: anisoAngleMap)
}
