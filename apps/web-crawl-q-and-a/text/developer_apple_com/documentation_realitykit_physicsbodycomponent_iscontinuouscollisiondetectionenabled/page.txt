var isContinuousCollisionDetectionEnabled: Bool
Discussion
Set the value to true to perform continuous collision detection. The value is false by default, indicating the simulation should apply discrete collision detection.
Discrete collision detection considers only the position of a body once per rendered frame, or about every 16 milliseconds at 60 frames per second. Continuous collision detection considers the position of the body throughout the frame interval. The latter is more computationally expensive, but can help to avoid missing a collision for a quickly moving object, like a projectile.
