func inspector<V>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> V
) -> some View where V : View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to Bool controlling the presented state.
content
The inspector content.
Discussion
Apply this modifier to declare an inspector with a context-dependent presentation. For example, an inspector can present as a trailing column in a horizontally regular size class, but adapt to a sheet in a horizontally compact size class.
struct ShapeEditor: View {
    @State var presented: Bool = false
    var body: some View {
        MyEditorView()
            .inspector(isPresented: $presented) {
                TextTraitsInspectorView()
            }
    }
}
Note
Trailing column inspectors have their presentation state restored by the framework.
