Structure
BlendTreeInvalidNode
A blend tree node that’s internal only or sources from an invalid definition.

struct BlendTreeInvalidNode
Overview
This structure adopts BlendTreeNode and adds the ability to detect a node that contains neither an animation nor any branches in the blend tree.
You don’t create instances of this structure. Instead, detect whether your blend-tree node matches the framework’s criteria for invalid nodes by checking the node type, as the following code demonstrates.
// Get the blend tree's root node.
guard let blendNode = blendTree.root as? BlendTreeBlendNode else { return }
for node in blendNode.sources {
    if let invalidNode = node as? BlendTreeInvalidNode {
        // Respond to invalid-node criteria.
Topics
