Instance Property
offset
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var offset: TimeInterval { get set }
Discussion
The default value is 0, which indicates that the animation plays with no offset. Setting a value for this property moves the animation data along the timeline and doesn’t change timing. If you set a fillMode other than none, the animation fills the vacant area created by the offset according to the characteristics of the specified fill mode.
