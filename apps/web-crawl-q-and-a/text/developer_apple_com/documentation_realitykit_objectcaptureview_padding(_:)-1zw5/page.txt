func padding(_ insets: EdgeInsets) -> some View
Parameters
insets
An EdgeInsets instance that contains padding amounts for each edge.
Return Value
A view that’s padded by different amounts on each edge.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add a different amount of padding on each edge of a view:
VStack {
    Text("Text padded by different amounts on each edge.")
        .padding(EdgeInsets(top: 10, leading: 20, bottom: 40, trailing: 0))
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The order in which you apply modifiers matters. The example above applies the padding before applying the border to ensure that the border encompasses the padded region:
To pad a view on specific edges with equal padding for all padded edges, use View/padding(_:_:). To pad all edges of a view equally, use View/padding(_:)-68shk.
