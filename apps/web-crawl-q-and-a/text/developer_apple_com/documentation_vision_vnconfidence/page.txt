typealias VNConfidence = Float
Discussion
The Vision framework normalizes this value to [0.0, 1.0] under most circumstances. A value of 0.0 indicates no confidence. A value of 1.0 indicates highest confidence, or the observation doesn’t support or assign meaning to confidence.
Note
When the results come from a VNCoreMLRequest, Vision forwards confidence values as-is and doesn’t normalize them.
