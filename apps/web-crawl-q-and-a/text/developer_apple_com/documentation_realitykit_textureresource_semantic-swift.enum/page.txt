Enumeration
TextureResource.Semantic
An object used to specify the intended usage of a texture.

enum Semantic
Overview
RealityKit uses image textures to transmit different types of data Metal shaders. For example, it uses textures to send RGB images with the base color of the entity, to send grayscale images holding roughness and metallic information, and to send surface normals for doing lighting calculations.
This object specifies the intended use of the texture by an individual property.
Topics
Specifying Intended Use
case raw
Use the texture unmodified.
case color
Use the texture to store colors data.
case hdrColor
Use the texture to store a high-dynamic range image.
case normal
Use the texture to store surface normals.
case scalar
Use the texture to store a single value in each pixel.
Comparing Enumeration Values
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value of the case.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the raw value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func == (TextureResource.Semantic, TextureResource.Semantic) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances aren’t equal.
