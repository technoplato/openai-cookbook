static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthDirection, ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthDirection) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case local
Emit direction is relative to the orientation of the emitter entity’s transform.
case normal
The emitting direction for each particle is along the surface normal vector at the point where the particle is emitted.
case world
Ignores the orientation from the emitter entity’s transform.
Initializers
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
