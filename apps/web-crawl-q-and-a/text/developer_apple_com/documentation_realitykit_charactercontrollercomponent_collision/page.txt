Initializers
init(characterEntity: Entity, hitEntity: Entity, hitPosition: SIMD3<Float>, hitNormal: SIMD3<Float>, moveDirection: SIMD3<Float>, moveDistance: Float)
Create Collision and initialize all fields.
Instance Properties
var characterEntity: Entity
Entity owning the character controller component.
var hitEntity: Entity
The entity that was hit by the character controller.
var hitNormal: SIMD3<Float>
Hit normal relative to physics origin. In physics space.
var hitPosition: SIMD3<Float>
Hit position relative to physics origin. In physics space.
var moveDirection: SIMD3<Float>
Move direction controller was moving (unit vector). In physics space.
var moveDistance: Float
