Instance Method
visualEffect3D(_:)
Applies effects to this view, while providing access to layout information via GeometryProxy3D.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func visualEffect3D(_ effect: @escaping (EmptyVisualEffect, GeometryProxy3D) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View
Parameters
effect
A closure that returns the effect to be applied. The first argument provided to the closure is a placeholder representing this view. The second argument is a GeometryProxy3D.
Return Value
A view with the effect applied.
Discussion
You return new effects by calling functions on the first argument provided to the effect closure. In this example, ContentView is offset in Z by its own depth, causing its back face to appear where the front face of the view was originally located:
ContentView()
    .visualEffect3D { content, geometryProxy in
        content.offset(z: geometryProxy.size.depth)
    }
