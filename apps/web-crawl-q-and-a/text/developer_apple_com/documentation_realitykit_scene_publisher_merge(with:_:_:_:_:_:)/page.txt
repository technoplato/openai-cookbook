    _ e: E,
    _ f: F,

) -> Publishers.Merge7<Self, B, C, D, E, F, G> where B : Publisher, C : Publisher, D : Publisher, E : Publisher, F : Publisher, G : Publisher, Self.Failure == B.Failure, Self.Output == B.Output, B.Failure == C.Failure, B.Output == C.Output, C.Failure == D.Failure, C.Output == D.Output, D.Failure == E.Failure, D.Output == E.Output, E.Failure == F.Failure, E.Output == F.Output, F.Failure == G.Failure, F.Output == G.Output
Parameters
b
A second publisher.
c
A third publisher.
d
A fourth publisher.
e
A fifth publisher.
f
A sixth publisher.
g
A seventh publisher.
Return Value
A publisher that emits an event when any upstream publisher emits an event.
Discussion
Use merge(with:_:_:_:_:_:) when you want to receive a new element whenever any of the upstream publishers emits an element. To receive tuples of the most-recent value from all the upstream publishers whenever any of them emit a value, use Publisher/combineLatest(_:_:_:)-48buc. To combine elements from multiple upstream publishers, use Publisher/zip(_:_:_:)-16rcy.
In this example, as merge(with:_:_:_:_:_:) receives input from the upstream publishers; it republishes the interleaved elements to the downstream:
let pubA = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubB = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubC = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubD = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubE = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubF = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pubG = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()


cancellable = pubA
    .merge(with: pubB, pubC, pubD, pubE, pubE, pubG)
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " " ) }


pubA.send(1)
pubB.send(40)
pubC.send(90)
pubD.send(-1)
pubE.send(33)
pubF.send(44)
pubG.send(54)


pubA.send(2)
pubB.send(50)
pubC.send(100)
pubD.send(-2)
pubE.send(33)
pubF.send(33)
pubG.send(54)


//Prints: "1 40 90 -1 33 44 54 2 50 100 -2 33 33 54"
The merged publisher continues to emit elements until all upstream publishers finish. If an upstream publisher produces an error, the merged publisher fails with that error.
