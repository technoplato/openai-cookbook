Sample Code
Detecting human body poses in 3D with Vision
Render skeletons of 3D body pose points in a scene overlaying the input image.
Download
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
Xcode 15.0+ Beta
Overview
Note
This sample code project is associated with WWDC23 session 111241: Explore 3D body pose and person segmentation in Vision.
Configure the sample code project
Before you run the sample code project in Xcode, ensure you’re using an iOS device with an A12 chip or later. The input image should have all limbs of the subject visible.
Note
Due to a behavior change with cameraOriginMatrix API, if this sample project is run on a device on a build earlier than beta 3, camera position will be rotated 180 degrees.
