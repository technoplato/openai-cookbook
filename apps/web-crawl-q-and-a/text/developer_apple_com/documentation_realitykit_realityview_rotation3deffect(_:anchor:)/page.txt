Instance Method
rotation3DEffect(_:anchor:)
Rotates this view by a specific amount.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func rotation3DEffect(
    _ rotation: Rotation3D,
    anchor: UnitPoint3D = .center
) -> some View
Parameters
rotation
The rotation by which to rotate the view.
anchor
The anchor point about which to rotate this view. Defaults to center.
Return Value
A view that rotates this view by rotation about anchor.
Discussion
The original dimensions of the view are considered to be unchanged by rotating the contents.
For example, to rotate a box by 45° about the Y axis:
Model3D("robot")
    .rotationEffect(Rotation3D(angle: .degrees(45), axis: .y))
