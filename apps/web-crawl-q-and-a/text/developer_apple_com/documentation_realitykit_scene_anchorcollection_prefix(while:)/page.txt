Instance Method
prefix(while:)
Returns a subsequence containing the initial elements until predicate returns false and skipping the remaining elements.

func prefix(while predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns true if the element should be included or false if it should be excluded. Once the predicate returns false it will not be called again.
Overview
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

func prefix(upTo: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the start of the collection up to, but not including, the specified position.

func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection.
func randomElement<T>(using: inout T) -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
