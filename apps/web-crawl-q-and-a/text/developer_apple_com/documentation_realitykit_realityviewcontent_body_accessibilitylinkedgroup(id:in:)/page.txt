    id: ID,

) -> some View where ID : Hashable
Parameters
id
A hashable identifier used to separate sets of linked elements within the same namespace. Elements with matching namespace and id will be linked together.
namespace
The namespace to use to organize linked accessibility elements. All elements marked with accessibilityLink in this namespace and with the specified id will be linked together.
Discussion
This can be useful to allow quickly jumping between content in a list and the same content shown in a detail view, for example. All elements marked with accessibilityLinkedGroup with the same namespace and identifier will be linked together.
