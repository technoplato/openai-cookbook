func scrollIndicators(
    _ visibility: ScrollIndicatorVisibility,
    axes: Axis.Set = [.vertical, .horizontal]
) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The visibility to apply to scrollable views.
axes
The axes of scrollable views that the visibility applies to.
Return Value
A view with the specified scroll indicator visibility.
Discussion
Use this modifier to hide or show scroll indicators on scrollable content in views like a ScrollView, List, or TextEditor. This modifier applies the prefered visibility to any scrollable content within a view hierarchy.
ScrollView {
    VStack(alignment: .leading) {
        ForEach(0..<100) {
            Text("Row \($0)")
        }
    }
}
.scrollIndicators(.hidden)
Use the ScrollIndicatorVisibility/hidden value to indicate that you prefer that views never show scroll indicators along a given axis. Use ScrollIndicatorVisibility/visible when you prefer that views show scroll indicators. Depending on platform conventions, visible scroll indicators might only appear while scrolling. Pass ScrollIndicatorVisibility/automatic to allow views to decide whether or not to show their indicators.
