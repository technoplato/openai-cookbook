Structure
CustomMaterial.Specular
An object that defines the specular highlights of an entity.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct Specular
Overview
In physically based rendering (PBR), specular highlights primarily come from the object’s roughness value. RealityKit renders materials that have a low roughness value with specular highlights based on the environment, lighting, and shape of the entity.
For more information on using specular values in a custom material, see specular.
Topics
Creating a Specular Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an object from a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?)
Creates an object from a single value, a UV-mapped texture, or both.
init(PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Specular)
Creates an object from a physically based material’s specular property.
Accessing Specular Values
var scale: Float
The specular value for the entire entity or a multiplier for values sampled from the material’s texture.
var texture: CustomMaterial.Texture?
The specular value as a UV-mapped image texture.
typealias FloatLiteralType
The type used to specify a single specular value for this material.

Creating Highlights
var specular: CustomMaterial.Specular
The bright highlights to apply to the entity.
var clearcoat: CustomMaterial.Clearcoat
The transparent highlights that simulate a clear, shiny coating on an entity.
struct Clearcoat
An object that defines the intensity of an entity’s clear, shiny coating.
var clearcoatRoughness: CustomMaterial.ClearcoatRoughness
The degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.
struct ClearcoatRoughness
An object that defines the degree to which an entity’s clear, shiny coating scatters light to create soft highlights.
