Initializers
init<Input>(generator: RandomNumberGenerator, () -> RandomTransformer)
Creates an augmenter from a random number generator and an augmentation builder.
Instance Methods
func applied<S, Annotation>(to: S) -> AugmentationSequence<S, RandomTransformer, RandomNumberGenerator, Annotation>
Applies an augmentation per input of the base sequence.
func applied<C, Annotation>(to: C, upsampledBy: Int) -> UpsampledAugmentationSequence<C, RandomTransformer, RandomNumberGenerator, Annotation>
Applies an augmentation repeatedly to an array of inputs.
