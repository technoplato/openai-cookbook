Case
MLObjectDetector.AnnotationType.boundingBox(units:origin:anchor:)
An annotation type that defines a rectangle around an object within an image.
macOS 10.15+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
case boundingBox(
    units: MLBoundingBoxUnits = .pixel,
    origin: MLBoundingBoxCoordinatesOrigin = .topLeft,
    anchor: MLBoundingBoxAnchor = .center
)
Discussion
To use bounding box annotations, you must tell Create ML how to interpret your annotations.
Use MLBoundingBoxUnits to specify the coordinate units of your bounding boxes. - Use MLBoundingBoxAnchor to specify the location in the bounding box its coordinates refer to. - Use MLBoundingBoxCoordinatesOrigin to specify the part of the image the annotations use as their origin.
Formatting a Bounding Box JSON Annotation File
The base of the JSON file must contain an array of the following JSON object structure.
Name
Type
Value
imagefilename
String
The name of the image’s file.
annotation
Array
An array of annotation JSON objects.
Each JSON object in the annotation array must have the following JSON object structure.
Name
Type
Value
label
String
The name of the annotated object.
coordinates
JSON object
The location of the object and the area it occupies in the image.
The coordinate JSON object must have the following structure. The origin of the image is the upper-left corner. The x-values increase from left to right, and the y-values increase from the top to the bottom.
Name
Type
Value
x
Number
The x-coordinate of the annotation’s origin, which MLBoundingBoxCoordinatesOrigin defines.
y
Number
The y-coordinate of the annotation’s origin, which MLBoundingBoxCoordinatesOrigin defines.
width
Number
The width of the annotation’s bounding box.
height
Number
The height of the annotation’s bounding box.
As an example, the following JSON file has correct structure with one image file ("cat and dog.png") in its base array, which has two annotations.
// JSON file
  [{
    "imagefilename": "cat and dog.png",
    "annotation":
    [
      {
        "label": "cat",
        "coordinates":
        {
          "y": 2.0,
          "x": 3.9,
          "height": 40.1,
          "width": 20.0
        }
      }, {
        "label": "dog",
        "coordinates":
        {
          "y": 40.0,
          "x": 38.9,
          "height": 100.1,
          "width": 70.0
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  ... ]
A typical annotation JSON file has many more objects in its base array, one for each image file.
