Instance Method
index(_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.

func index(
    _ i: Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int,
    limitedBy limit: Self.Index
) -> Self.Index?
Parameters
i
A valid index of the array.
distance
The distance to offset i.
limit
A valid index of the collection to use as a limit. If distance > 0, limit should be greater than i to have any effect. Likewise, if distance < 0, limit should be less than i to have any effect.
Return Value
An index offset by distance from the index i, unless that index would be beyond limit in the direction of movement. In that case, the method returns nil.
Discussion
The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from an array’s starting index and then prints the element at that position. The operation doesn’t require going beyond the limiting numbers.endIndex value, so it succeeds.
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
let i = numbers.index(numbers.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
print(numbers[i])
// Prints "50"
The next example attempts to retrieve an index ten positions from numbers.startIndex, but fails, because that distance is beyond the index passed as limit.
let j = numbers.index(numbers.startIndex,
                      offsetBy: 10,
                      limitedBy: numbers.endIndex)
print(j)
// Prints "nil"
The value passed as distance must not offset i beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as limit prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.

Manipulating Indices
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first row in a nonempty DataTable. If the DataTable is empty, startIndex is equal to endIndex.
var endIndex: Int
The DataTable’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
