Discussion
Do not call this initializer directly. It is used by the compiler when you use an array literal. Instead, create a new set using an array literal as its value by enclosing a comma-separated list of values in square brackets. You can use an array literal anywhere a set is expected by the type context.
Here, a set of strings is created from an array literal holding only strings:
let ingredients: Set = ["cocoa beans", "sugar", "cocoa butter", "salt"]
if ingredients.isSuperset(of: ["sugar", "salt"]) {
    print("Whatever it is, it's bound to be delicious!")
}
// Prints "Whatever it is, it's bound to be delicious!"
