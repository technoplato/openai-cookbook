Instance Method
addTorque(_:relativeTo:)
Applies a torque to the physics body at its center of mass.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func addTorque(
    _ torque: SIMD3<Float>,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
torque
A torque in newton meters per radian.
Discussion
The physics simulator applies the added torque until the end of the frame interval. To continue exerting the torque after that time, add the torque again with another call to the method. Handle the SceneEvents.Update event to receive an indication of when the frame interval ends. For an app that renders at 60 frames per second (fps), this event occurs about once per 16 milliseconds.
referenceEntity: The reference entity that defines the coordinate space in which torque is defined.
