func collect(_ count: Int) -> Publishers.CollectByCount<Self>
Parameters
count
The maximum number of received elements to buffer before publishing.
Return Value
A publisher that collects up to the specified number of elements, and then publishes them as an array.
Discussion
Use Publisher/collect(_:) to emit arrays of at most count elements from an upstream publisher. If the upstream publisher finishes before collecting the specified number of elements, the publisher sends an array of only the items it received. This may be fewer than count elements.
If the upstream publisher fails with an error, this publisher forwards the error to the downstream receiver instead of sending its output.
In the example below, the Publisher/collect(_:) operator emits one partial and two full arrays based on the requested collection size of 5:
let numbers = (0...10)
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .collect(5)
    .sink { print("\($0), terminator: " "") }


// Prints "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] [10] "
Note
When this publisher receives a request for .max(n) elements, it requests .max(count * n) from the upstream publisher.

Reducing Elements
func collect() -> Publishers.Collect<Self>
Collects all received elements, and emits a single array of the collection when the upstream publisher finishes.
func collect<S>(Publishers.TimeGroupingStrategy<S>, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.CollectByTime<Self, S>
Collects elements by a given time-grouping strategy, and emits a single array of the collection.
func ignoreOutput() -> Publishers.IgnoreOutput<Self>
Ignores all upstream elements, but passes along the upstream publisher’s completion state (finished or failed).
func reduce<T>(T, (T, Self.Output) -> T) -> Publishers.Reduce<Self, T>
Applies a closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.
func tryReduce<T>(T, (T, Self.Output) throws -> T) -> Publishers.TryReduce<Self, T>
Applies an error-throwing closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.
