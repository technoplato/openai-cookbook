Discussion
A volumetric glass material is a 3D object that includes thickness, specular, glass blur, shadow, and others. Because of its physical depth attribute, it influences Z-axis layout; the UI content should be generally placed within the glass background, instead of on top of it as when using layouts like View/overlay or ZStack.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
