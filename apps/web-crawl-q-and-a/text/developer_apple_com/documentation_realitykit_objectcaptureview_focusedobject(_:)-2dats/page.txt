func focusedObject<T>(_ object: T) -> some View where T : ObservableObject
Parameters
object
The observable object to associate with focus.
Return Value
A view that supplies an observable object when in focus.
Discussion
Use this method instead of View/focusedSceneObject(_:) when your scene includes multiple focusable views with their own associated data, and you need an app- or scene-scoped element like a command or toolbar item that operates on the data associated with whichever view currently has focus. Each focusable view can supply its own object:
struct MessageView: View {
    @StateObject private var message = Message(...)


    var body: some View {
        TextField(...)
            .focusedObject(message)
    }
}
Interested views can then use the FocusedObject property wrapper to observe and update the focused viewâ€™s object. In this example, an app command updates the focused viewâ€™s data, and is automatically disabled when focus is in an unrelated part of the scene:
struct MessageCommands: Commands {
    @FocusedObject private var message: Message?


    var body: some Commands {
        CommandGroup(after: .pasteboard) {
            Button("Add Duck to Message") {
                message?.text.append(" ðŸ¦†")
            }
            .keyboardShortcut("d")
            .disabled(message == nil)
        }
    }
}
