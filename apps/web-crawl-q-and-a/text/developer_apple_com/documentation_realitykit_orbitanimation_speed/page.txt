Instance Property
speed
A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var speed: Float { get set }
Discussion
The default value is 1.0, which doesn’t alter the animation’s duration. A value of 2.0 indicates that the duration is half the normal rate. A value of 0.5 indicates that the duration is twice the normal rate. Negative values play the animation in reverse.
This property doesn’t affect the animation’s delay.
