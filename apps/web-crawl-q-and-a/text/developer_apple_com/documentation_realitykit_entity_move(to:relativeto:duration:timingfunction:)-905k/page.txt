Instance Method
move(to:relativeTo:duration:timingFunction:)
Moves an entity over a period of time to a new location given by a transform.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@discardableResult @MainActor
func move(
    to target: Transform,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?,
    duration: TimeInterval,
    timingFunction: AnimationTimingFunction = .default
) -> AnimationPlaybackController
Parameters
target
A Transform instance that indicates the new location.
referenceEntity
The entity that defines a frame of reference. Set this to nil to indicate world space.
duration
The time in seconds over which the move should occur.
timingFunction
A timing function that controls the progress of the animation.
Return Value
An AnimationPlaybackController instance that you use to control the animation playback.
Discussion
Note: Animating the scale of an entity to 0 will cause a subsequent inverse of the entity’s transform to return NaN values. Developers may consider animating the scale of an entity to a small non-zero value. When the move completes, the entity can then be hidden or removed if applicable to the use case.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
