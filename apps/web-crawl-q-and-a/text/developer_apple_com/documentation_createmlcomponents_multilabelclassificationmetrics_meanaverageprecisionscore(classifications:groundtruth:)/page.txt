static func meanAveragePrecisionScore(
    classifications: some Sequence<ClassificationDistribution<Label>>,
    groundTruth: some Sequence<Set<Label>>
) -> Float
Available when Label conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
classifications
A sequence of multi-label classifications.
groundTruth
A sequence of multi-label correct labels.
Return Value
The mean average precision.
Discussion
An average precision score summarizes the precision-recall curve for a label. The mean average precision is the mean of the average precision scores for all the classification labels.
