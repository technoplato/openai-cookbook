init(scene: Scene)
Required
Parameters
scene
The scene this system affects.
Discussion
There’s no need to instantiate your own systems, so don’t call this method. Instead, register your system with RealityKit by calling registerSystem(). RealityKit automatically creates an instance of every registered system for every scene.
