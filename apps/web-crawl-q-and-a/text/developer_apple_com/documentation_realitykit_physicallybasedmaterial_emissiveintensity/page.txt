Instance Property
emissiveIntensity
The intensity of light emitted by the entity.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var emissiveIntensity: Float { get set }
Discussion
To make a material emissive and appear to emit light, set this property to a value greater than zero and set emissiveColor to a value other than black. RealityKit multiplies emissiveColor by this value, so the higher the value, the more intense the entity’s emission of light.
You can set this property to values greater than 1.0.
