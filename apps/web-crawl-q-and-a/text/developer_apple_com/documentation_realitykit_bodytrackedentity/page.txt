class BodyTrackedEntity
Overview
Like a ModelEntity, a BodyTrackedEntity has a ModelComponent that defines its physical appearance. Unlike a model entity, a body-tracked entity lacks the components required to participate in collisions or physics simulations. Instead, a BodyTrackingComponent drives the positioning and arrangement of the entity based on tracking information from the AR session.
For an example of how to use a body-tracked entity, see Capturing Body Motion in 3D.
Topics
