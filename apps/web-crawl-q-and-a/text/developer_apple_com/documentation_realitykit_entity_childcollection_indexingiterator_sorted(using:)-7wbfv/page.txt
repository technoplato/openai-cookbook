Instance Method
sorted(using:)
Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given array of SortComparators to compare elements.

func sorted<S, Comparator>(using comparators: S) -> [Self.Element] where S : Sequence, Comparator : SortComparator, Comparator == S.Element, Self.Element == Comparator.Compared
Parameters
comparators
an array of comparators used to compare elements. The first comparator specifies the primary comparator to be used in sorting the sequence’s elements. Any subsequent comparators are used to further refine the order of elements with equal values.
Return Value
an array of the elements sorted using comparators.
