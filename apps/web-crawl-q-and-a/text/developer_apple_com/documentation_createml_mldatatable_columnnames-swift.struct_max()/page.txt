@warn_unqualified_access
func max() -> Self.Element?
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
Return Value
The sequence’s maximum element. If the sequence has no elements, returns nil.
Discussion
This example finds the largest value in an array of height measurements.
let heights = [67.5, 65.7, 64.3, 61.1, 58.5, 60.3, 64.9]
let greatestHeight = heights.max()
print(greatestHeight)
// Prints "Optional(67.5)"
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
