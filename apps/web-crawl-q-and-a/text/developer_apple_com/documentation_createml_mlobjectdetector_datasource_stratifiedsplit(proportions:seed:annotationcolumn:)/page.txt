Generates a new data table by splitting the data source using the specified proportions.
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func stratifiedSplit(
    proportions: [Double],
    seed: Int = timestampSeed(),
    annotationColumn: String
) throws -> MLDataTable
Return Value
An MLDataTable containing the data source’s split contents.
Discussion
proportions: An array of doubles, each representing a portion of the data source. If these values don’t add up to 1.0, the method normalizes the numbers so that they do.
seed: The value the method uses to initialize the random-number generator, which affects how the method splits the data.
annotationColumn: The name of the column the method uses to split the data.
