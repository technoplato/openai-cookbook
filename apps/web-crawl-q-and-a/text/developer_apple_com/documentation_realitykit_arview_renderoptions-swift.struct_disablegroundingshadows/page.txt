static let disableGroundingShadows: ARView.RenderOptions
Discussion
Objects in the real world cast a grounding shadow onto adjacent surfaces due to ambient light. This provides viewers with a visual cue that the object is in close proximity to the surface. Objects without a grounding shadow appear disconnected from their environment. To create the same visual cue for virtual objects, RealityKit provides a grounding shadow effect.
Applying this effect involves a low, constant GPU cost. You can disable the effect by adding the disableGroundingShadows option to the view’s renderOptions set, if needed. Disabling the effect is most useful for older devices, like those with an A9 processor or earlier.
