Initializer
init(validation:maxIterations:penalty:convergenceThreshold:featureRescaling:)
Creates a new set of parameters.
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    validation: MLSupportVectorClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData = .split(strategy: .automatic),
    maxIterations: Int = 11,
    penalty: Double = 1.0,
    convergenceThreshold: Double = 0.01,
    featureRescaling: Bool = true
)
Parameters
validation
The data used to monitor how well the model is generalizing.
The default is to automatically split off some data from the training set for validation.
maxIterations
The maximum number of passes through the data.
The default value is 11.
penalty
Weight of the regularizer. The larger the penalty the less variance in the model.
The default value is 1.0.
convergenceThreshold
The threshold with which to determine if the model has converged. Consider reducing this value for higher training accuracy, but beware of overfitting.
The default value is 0.01.
featureRescaling
Determines if the features should be preprocessed to ensure all features are on the same scale.
The default value is true.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
