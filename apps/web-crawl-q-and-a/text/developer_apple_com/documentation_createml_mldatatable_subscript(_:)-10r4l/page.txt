Instance Subscript
subscript(_:)
Creates a subset of the table by masking the rows with the given untyped column.

subscript(mask: MLUntypedColumn) -> MLDataTable { get }
Overview
Use this untyped column–based subscript to create a new table by masking a subset of the table rows. The derived table will not include rows where mask contains a default value for its underlying type, such as:
0 in untyped Int columns - 0.0 in untyped Double columns - An empty string in untyped String columns
The derived data table includes rows where the masking column has any other (nondefault) value.
For example, to filter the values in a data table as shown above, begin by creating a table with the original data.
    "Title": ["Alice in Wonderland", "Hamlet", "Dracula", "Peter Pan", "The Great Gatsby"],
    "Genre": ["Fantasy", "Drama", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Drama"],
    "Pages": [124, 98, 0, 94, 0]
]


guard let table = try? MLDataTable(dictionary: data) else {
    fatalError("Invalid dictionary data")
} ```


After you create the table, use the `String`-based
``MLDataTable/subscript(_:)-3wjk`` to extract a column.


```swift // Create a new untyped column "pagesColumn" copied from the
table’s "Pages" column let pagesColumn = table["Pages"] ```


Use `subscript(mask: MLUntypedColumn)` with an untyped column–row mask
to create a filtered table. The subscript uses the untyped values to
determine whether to keep a row.


In this example, the untyped column `pagesColumn` has an underlying type
of `Int`. The subscript removes any row with a value of `0` (the default
value for `Int`) and keeps all other rows.


```swift // Filter the table using pagesColumn. // Each row with a value
of 0 is removed. let validPageCountTable = table[pagesColumn] ```


- Parameters:
- mask: An untyped column indicating whether rows should be removed (a
default value) or included (any nondefault value) in the derived table.


- Returns: A new data table.
