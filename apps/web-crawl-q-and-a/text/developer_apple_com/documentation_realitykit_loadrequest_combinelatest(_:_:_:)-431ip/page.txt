func combineLatest<P, Q, R>(
    _ publisher1: P,
    _ publisher2: Q,
    _ publisher3: R
) -> Publishers.CombineLatest4<Self, P, Q, R> where P : Publisher, Q : Publisher, R : Publisher, Self.Failure == P.Failure, P.Failure == Q.Failure, Q.Failure == R.Failure
Parameters
publisher1
A second publisher to combine with the first publisher.
publisher2
A third publisher to combine with the first publisher.
publisher3
A fourth publisher to combine with the first publisher.
Return Value
A publisher that receives and combines elements from this publisher and three other publishers.
Discussion
Use Publisher/combineLatest(_:_:_:)-48buc when you want the downstream subscriber to receive a tuple of the most-recent element from multiple publishers when any of them emit a value. To combine elements from multiple publishers, use Publisher/zip(_:_:_:)-16rcy instead. To receive just the most-recent element from multiple publishers rather than tuples, use Publisher/merge(with:_:_:).
Tip
The combined publisher doesn’t produce elements until each of its upstream publishers publishes at least one element.
The combined publisher passes through any requests to all upstream publishers. However, it still obeys the demand-fulfilling rule of only sending the request amount downstream. If the demand isn’t Subscribers/Demand/unlimited, it drops values from upstream publishers. It implements this by using a buffer size of 1 for each upstream, and holds the most-recent value in each buffer.
All upstream publishers need to finish for this publisher to finish. If an upstream publisher never publishes a value, this publisher never finishes.
In the example below, Publisher/combineLatest(_:_:_:)-48buc receives input from any of the publishers, combines the latest value from each publisher into a tuple and publishes it:
let pub = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pub2 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pub3 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
let pub4 = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()


cancellable = pub
    .combineLatest(pub2, pub3, pub4)
    .sink { print("Result: \($0).") }


pub.send(1)
pub.send(2)
pub2.send(2)
pub3.send(9)
pub4.send(1)


pub.send(3)
pub2.send(12)
pub.send(13)
pub3.send(19)
//
// Prints:
//  Result: (2, 2, 9, 1).
//  Result: (3, 2, 9, 1).
//  Result: (3, 12, 9, 1).
//  Result: (13, 12, 9, 1).
//  Result: (13, 12, 19, 1).
If any individual publisher of the combined set terminates with a failure, this publisher also fails.
