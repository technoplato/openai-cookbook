Enumeration
ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState
State of the capture session.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
enum CaptureState
Overview
A session starts in .initializing state and proceeds through the other states via use of function calls until it reaches an end state. A session is over when the capture state is set to .completed or .failed(Error).
Topics
Operators
static func == (ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState, ObjectCaptureSession.CaptureState) -> Bool
Two states are defined equal if they have the same case. Specifically, a .failed(Error) state will match any other failed state regardless of the actual error payload.
Enumeration Cases
case capturing
Auto-capture is in progress.
case completed
The session has saved its data and can now be safely torn down and the images folder used for reconstruction.
case detecting
The object selection box is being detected / manipulated and is not yet complete. A call to startCapturing() in this state will move the session to .capturing to begin capturing the object indicated within the currently specified bounding box.
case failed(Error)
There was an unrecoverable error and the session is now invalid and needs to be torn down.
case finishing
The session is saving outstanding data and finishing up.
case initializing
The session and camera feed are initializing.
case ready
The session is ready to begin taking calls to capture.
