init(
    labeledBySubdirectoryNamesAt url: URL,
    type: UTType,
    continueOnFailure: Bool = false
) throws
Parameters
url
URL of directory containing the files.
type
Type of files.
continueOnFailure
A Boolean value indicating whether to continue reading files after encountering a file that is not readable. The default value is false.
Discussion
Take for example this directory structure:
/
    foo/
        file1.png
        file2.png
    bar/
        file3.png
        file4.png
It would produce two labels (foo and bar) with two URLs each.

Creating the Feature
init(labeledByNamesAt: URL, separator: Character, index: Int, type: UTType, continueOnFailure: Bool) throws
Reads training examples from a directory containing files having their labels in the name. The name can contain multiple words separated by a separator. So the index tells the position of the label in the file name. Files with incorrect name format are ignored.
