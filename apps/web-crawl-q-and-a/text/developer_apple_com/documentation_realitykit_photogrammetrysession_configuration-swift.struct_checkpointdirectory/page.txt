checkpointDirectory
For macOS reconstruction, the checkpoint directory is used as a temporary reconstruction space if it is not nil. Reconstruction always starts from scratch, there is no resuming.

var checkpointDirectory: URL?
Discussion
For iOS reconstruction, if the same checkpoint directory used by ObjectCaptureSession or a previous interrupted PhotogrammetrySession is passed in, PhotogrammetrySession will try to use the previously saved checkpoint for this reconstruction rather than starting from scratch on the images. A checkpointDirectory should be unique for each images folder.
If set to an empty folder, the checkpointDirectory will be used to save checkpoints during processing to be reused in a subsequent restart. If it is nil, no checkpoints will be used or saved and every reconstruction will start from scratch on the images folder.
If checkpointDirectory is set but a found checkpoint is not compatible with the image folder or other configuration settings, the session will also start from scratch and write new checkpoints into this folder.
