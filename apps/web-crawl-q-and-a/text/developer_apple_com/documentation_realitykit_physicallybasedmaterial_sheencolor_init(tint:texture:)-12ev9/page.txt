init(tint:texture:)
Creates a sheen color in macOS.

init(
    tint: NSColor = .white,
    texture: MaterialParameters.Texture? = nil
)
Parameters
tint
The tint color.
texture
The optional image texture.
Discussion
This initializer creates an object from a color, an image texture, or from both. If you don’t provide a tint color, tint defaults to white.
If you specify texture, RealityKit calculates the final sheen color for the entity by UV-mapping texture onto the entity and then multiplying the color at any given pixel by tint. If tint is white, RealityKit uses the texture untinted.
If you don’t specify texture, then RealityKit uses tint as the entity’s sheen color.
