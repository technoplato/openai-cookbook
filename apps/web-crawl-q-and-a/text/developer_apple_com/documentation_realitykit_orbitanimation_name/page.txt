Configuring the Animation
var startTransform: Transform
The pose of the orbiting object at the start of the animation.
var axis: SIMD3<Float>
A 3D vector that points in the direction of the axis around which to rotate.
var bindTarget: BindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
var blendLayer: Int32
The order in which the framework composites the animation.
var rotationCount: Float
The number of times to rotate the target entity before stopping.
var spinClockwise: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the object orbits the center point in the clockwise direction.
var orientToPath: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the orbiting object updates its orientation during the animation to orient itself along the rotation path.
var additive: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
