GroupAction
An action that runs a list of other actions.
Overview
This action defines how the runtime executes each action in the actions array. When type is serial, the runtime performs actions one after the other. When type is concurrent, the runtime starts each action at the same time.
When this action’s type is serial, you can specify a delay between two actions by placing a WaitAction between them.
Declaration
class Preliminary_Action "GroupAction"
Create a Sequential or Looping Group Action
The following example defines a group of actions that run sequentially. The group contains a flip action, a wait action, and a hide action.
def Preliminary_Action "SimpleGroup" (
    inherits = </GroupAction>
)
{
    rel actions = [ <Flip>, <Wait>, <Hide> ]
    uniform bool loops = false
    uniform uint performCount = 1


    def Action "Flip" (
        inherits = </EmphasizeAction>
    )
    {
        uniform token motionType = "flip"
    }


    def Action "Wait" (
        inherits = </WaitAction>
    )
    {
    }


    def Action "Hide" (
        inherits = </VisibilityAction>
    )
    {
        uniform token type = "hide"
    }
}
The following group named EndlessLoop repeats a set of actions indefinitely because performCount is 0.
def Action "EndlessLoop" (
    inherits = </GroupAction>
)
{
    rel actions = [...]
    uniform bool loops = true
    uniform uint performCount = 0
}
