Initializer
init(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)
Creates a new context object.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
init(
    _ device: MTLDevice,
    _ commandBuffer: MTLCommandBuffer,
    _ sourceColorTexture: MTLTexture,
    _ sourceDepthTexture: MTLTexture,
    _ targetColorTexture: MTLTexture,
    _ projection: float4x4,
    _ time: TimeInterval
)
Parameters
device
The Metal device the view renders to.
commandBuffer
The Metal command buffer that encodes this view.
sourceColorTexture
A texture containing the rendered frame.
sourceDepthTexture
A texture containing the frame’s depth buffer.
targetColorTexture
A texture the callback function writes to.
projection
The projection matrix for this frame.
time
The current elapsed time.
Discussion
This initializer creates a new postprocess context object. RealityKit creates context objects and passes them to the postprocess render callback. Your code won’t usually need to create context objects directly.
