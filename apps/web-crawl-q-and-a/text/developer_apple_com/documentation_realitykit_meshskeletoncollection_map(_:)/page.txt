Swift
Instance Method
map(_:)
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func map<T>(_ transform: (Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Parameters
transform
A mapping closure. transform accepts an element of this sequence as its parameter and returns a transformed value of the same or of a different type.
Return Value
An array containing the transformed elements of this sequence.
Discussion
In this example, map is used first to convert the names in the array to lowercase strings and then to count their characters.
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
let lowercaseNames = cast.map { $0.lowercased() }
// 'lowercaseNames' == ["vivien", "marlon", "kim", "karl"]
let letterCounts = cast.map { $0.count }
// 'letterCounts' == [6, 6, 3, 4]
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
