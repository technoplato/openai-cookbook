Instance Method
drop(while:)
Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.

@preconcurrency
func drop(while predicate: @escaping (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence<Self>
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element as a parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating whether to drop the element from the modified sequence.
Return Value
An asynchronous sequence that skips over values from the base sequence until the provided closure returns false.
Overview
Use drop(while:) to omit elements from an asynchronous sequence until the element received meets a condition you specify.
In this example, an asynchronous sequence called Counter produces Int values from 1 to 10. The drop(while:) method causes the modified sequence to ignore received values until it encounters one that is divisible by 3:
let stream = Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .drop { $0 % 3 != 0 }
for await number in stream {
    print("\(number) ", terminator: " ")
}
// prints "3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
After the predicate returns false, the sequence never executes it again, and from then on the sequence passes through elements from its underlying sequence as-is.

Filtering the Output
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfies the given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence<Self>
Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence<Self>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
