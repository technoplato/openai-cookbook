Topics
Operators
static func == (ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback, ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case environmentLowLight
The lighting in the environment is low, which can degrade reconstruction quality. Auto-capture still proceeds but reconstruction quality may suffer. It is advised to increase lighting.
case environmentTooDark
The lighting in the environment is too dark to proceed. Auto-capture will stop and the user will need to increase lighting levels to resolve this condition in order to continue capture.
case movingTooFast
The user is moving too quickly for clear images and the capturing may be paused to ensure quality.
case objectNotFlippable
It is not recommended to flip this object since is is unlikely the algorithm will be able to stitch the flipped orientation. This is usually due to feature-less, low-texture objects. In this case, multiple passes at different heights leaving object at its original orientation are recommended instead of flipping.
case objectTooClose
The camera is too close to the object and it cannot be tracked well.
case objectTooFar
The camera is too far from the object and it cannot be captured well.
case outOfFieldOfView
The bounding box of the object is not in the field of view of the camera so auto-capture will not operate.
case overCapturing
If the numberOfShotsTaken > maximumNumberOfInputImages then any additional shots will not be used in an on-device reconstruction and reconstruction is recommended to be done on a Mac that can support a greater number of images.
Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the given hasher.
