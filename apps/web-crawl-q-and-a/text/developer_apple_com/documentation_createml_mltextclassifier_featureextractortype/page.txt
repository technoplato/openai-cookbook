Selecting an Algorithm Type
case crf(revision: Int?)
A text classification algorithm that uses a statistical model of transition probabilities between words.
case maxEnt(revision: Int?)
A text classification algorithm that uses multinomial logistic regression based on the frequencies of words, independent of context.
case transferLearning(MLTextClassifier.FeatureExtractorType, revision: Int?)
A text classification algorithm that uses transfer learning by leveraging a feature extractor to generate embeddings.
