@MainActor
func resetPhysicsTransform(recursive: Bool = true)
Parameters
recursive
Apply the reset to all descendant entities.
Discussion
Call this method only for dynamic rigid bodies, with a mode of PhysicsBodyMode.dynamic. This is the only kind of body that’s affected by physics simulations. For all others, modify the entity’s transform property directly.
Conversely, directly modifying the transform of a dynamic body has no effect because the physics simulation overwrites it on every frame.
