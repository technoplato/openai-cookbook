enum FeatureExtractorType
Overview
Create ML has one built-in feature extractor: scenePrint. Alternatively, you can provide your own custom feature extractor from an .mlmodel file or a specific layer within a model file.
Topics
Selecting a Feature Extractor Type
case scenePrint(revision: Int?)
A feature extractor trained on millions of images.
case custom(MLImageClassifier.CustomFeatureExtractor)
A feature extractor that you provide as a Core ML model file or a layer within that file.
struct CustomFeatureExtractor
A custom feature extractor a training session uses to train an image classifier.
Describing a Feature Extractor Type
var description: String
A text representation of the feature extractor.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the feature extractor that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the feature extractor shown in a playground.
