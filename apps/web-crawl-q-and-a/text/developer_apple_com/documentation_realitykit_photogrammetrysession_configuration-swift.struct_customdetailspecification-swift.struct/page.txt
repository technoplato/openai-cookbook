struct TextureMapOutputs
Allows specification of the set of output texture maps to be included in the output model.
Operators
static func == (PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification, PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init()
Instance Properties
var maximumPolygonCount: UInt
The upper limit on polygons in the model mesh.
var maximumTextureDimension: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification.TextureDimension
The maximum dimension of the reconstructed texture maps.
var outputTextureMaps: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification.TextureMapOutputs
The set of texture maps to create in the model.
var textureFormat: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification.TextureFormat
The data type of the texture map.
Enumerations
enum TextureDimension
One of the discrete texture dimensions to specify the size of the model texture maps. For example, a .twoK dimension means the texture map size can be up to size 2048x2048.
enum TextureFormat
The output format to use for all textures.
