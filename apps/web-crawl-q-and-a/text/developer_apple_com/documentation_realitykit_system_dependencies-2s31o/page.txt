Discussion
If you need to specify the update order between your system and other systems in your app, you can do that using this property. If your system has no dependencies, you don’t need to declare this property. RealityKit provides a default implementation for systems with no dependencies.
Here’s an example where one other system must update before this system, and another system must update after it.
class SystemB : RealityKit.System {
    static var dependencies: [SystemDependency] {
        [.after(SystemA.self),        // Run SystemB after SystemA.
         .before(SystemC.self)]       // Run SystemB before SystemC.
     }
    // ...
}
When the app runs, RealityKit calls update(context:) on SystemA first, then on SystemB, and then on SystemC.
