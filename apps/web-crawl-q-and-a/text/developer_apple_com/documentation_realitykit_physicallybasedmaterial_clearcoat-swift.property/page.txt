Discussion
An entity in RealityKit can display a clearcoat, which is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear transparent coating, like the paint on a car, or the surface of lacquered objects. By default, materials don’t have clearcoat enabled.
Use this property to enable clearcoat rendering. Specifying any value greater than 0.0 turns clearcoat rendering on. A value of 1.0 indicates a full clearcoat. RealityKit treats values above 1.0 as if they’re 1.0.
You can specify clearcoat using a single Float that applies to the entire material, or a UV-mapped grayscale image to provide different values for different parts of an entity.
The following example specifies clearcoat using a single value:
material.clearcoat = .init(floatLiteral: 0.8)
And this example shows how to specify clearcoat using a UV-mapped image texture:
if let clearcoatResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:"entity_clearcoat") {
    let clearcoatMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(clearcoatResource)
    material.clearcoat = .init(texture: clearcoatMap)
}
