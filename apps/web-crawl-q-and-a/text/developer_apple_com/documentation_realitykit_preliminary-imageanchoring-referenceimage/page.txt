preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage
The characteristics of an image the runtime should scan for in order to attach a prim.
Overview
An asset assigns this property a prim with type Preliminary_ReferenceImage.
The runtime searches for an image described by this property in the physical environment. If the runtime finds a match, it places a prim at the image’s real-world location. When a runtime places a prim in the physical environment, the prim’s children also attach to that location.
The runtime employs the information contained in this property only when preliminary:anchoring:type is image.
Declaration
rel preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage
Anchor a Cube to an Image
The following example demonstrates how an asset defines a reference image (ImageReference) that the runtime should look for in the physical environment. The asset includes a cube that assigns an Preliminary_ReferenceImage to its preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage property, instructing the runtime to anchor it to a real-world object that matches the image criteria.
def Cube "ImageAnchoredCube" (
    prepend apiSchemas = [ "Preliminary_AnchoringAPI" ]
)
{
    uniform token preliminary:anchoring:type = "image"
    rel preliminary:imageAnchoring:referenceImage = <ImageReference>
    ...


    def Preliminary_ReferenceImage "ImageReference"
    {
      uniform asset image = @image.png@
      uniform double physicalWidth = 0.12
    }
}
