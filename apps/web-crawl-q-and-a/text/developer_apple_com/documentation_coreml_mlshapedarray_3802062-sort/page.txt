Generic Instance Method
sort(using:)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a sequence of comparators.

mutating func sort<S, Comparator>(using comparators: S) where S : Sequence, Comparator : SortComparator, Comparator == S.Element, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar> == Comparator.Compared
Parameters
comparators
A sequence of shaped-array slice comparators.

Modifying a Shaped Array
func swapAt(Int, Int)
Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.
func partition(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int
Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.
func sort<Comparator>(using: Comparator)
Reorders a shaped array by sorting its slices with a comparator.
func sort(by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool)
Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
func reverse()
Reverses the elements of the collection in place.
func shuffle()
Shuffles the collection in place.
func shuffle<T>(using: inout T)
Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
