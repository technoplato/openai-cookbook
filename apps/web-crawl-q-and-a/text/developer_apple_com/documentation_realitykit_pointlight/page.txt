class PointLight
Overview
During an AR session, RealityKit automatically lights your virtual objects to match real-world lighting. You can also explicitly add virtual lights that act upon your virtual content. This is typically most useful outside of an AR session (with the view’s cameraMode property set to ARView.CameraMode.nonAR).
The point light is an omnidirectional light that illuminates all the virtual content within a configurable radius from the light. You can configure the light’s color and intensity.
A RealityKit scene can contain up to eight dynamic lights, which are SpotLight, PointLight, and DirectionalLight entities. This limit doesn’t include light from image-based lighting.
