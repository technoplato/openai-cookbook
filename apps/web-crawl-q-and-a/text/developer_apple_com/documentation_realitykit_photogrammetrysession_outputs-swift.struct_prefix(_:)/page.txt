Instance Method
prefix(_:)
Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.

func prefix(_ count: Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>
Parameters
count
The maximum number of elements to return. The value of count must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
An asynchronous sequence starting at the beginning of the base sequence with at most count elements.
Overview
Use prefix(_:) to reduce the number of elements produced by the asynchronous sequence.
In this example, an asynchronous sequence called Counter produces Int values from 1 to 10. The prefix(_:) method causes the modified sequence to pass through the first six values, then end.
for await number in Counter(howHigh: 10).prefix(6) {
    print("\(number) ")
}
// prints "1 2 3 4 5 6"
If the count passed to prefix(_:) exceeds the number of elements in the base sequence, the result contains all of the elements in the sequence.

Filtering the Output
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfies the given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence<Self>
Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence<Self>
Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence<Self>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
