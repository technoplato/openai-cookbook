Overview
Use a data source to represent a dataset for training, validating, or testing a sound classifier.
Topics
Creating a Data Source
case labeledDirectories(at: URL)
Creates a data source from a folder with subfolders that each contain audio files.
case labeledFiles(at: URL)
Creates a data source from a folder that contains audio files, each named after the sound they represent.
case filesByLabel([String : [URL]])
Creates a data source from a dictionary.
case features(table: MLDataTable, featureColumn: String, labelColumn: String, parameters: MLSoundClassifier.FeatureExtractionParameters)
Creates a data source from a data table of audio features.
case featuresDataFrame(DataFrame, featureColumn: String, labelColumn: String, parameters: MLSoundClassifier.FeatureExtractionParameters)
Creates a data source from a data frame of audio features.
struct FeatureExtractionParameters
Parameters that affect the process of extracting sound features from audio files.
Retrieving the Data
func labeledSounds() throws -> [String : [URL]]
Generates a dictionary of the data source’s labeled audio files.
Partitioning the Data
func stratifiedSplit(proportions: [Double], seed: Int) throws -> [[String : [URL]]]
Generates an array of labeled audio dictionaries by splitting the data source into strata.
func stratifiedSplit<RNG>(proportions: [Double], generator: inout RNG) throws -> [[String : [URL]]]
Generates an array of labeled audio dictionaries by splitting the data source into strata using the random-number generator.
