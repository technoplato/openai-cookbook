func compactMap<T>(_ transform: @escaping (Self.Output) -> T?) -> Publishers.CompactMap<Self, T>
Parameters
transform
A closure that receives a value and returns an optional value.
Return Value
Any non-nil optional results of the calling the supplied closure.
Discussion
Combine’s compactMap(_:) operator performs a function similar to that of doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Sequence/2950916-compactmap in the Swift standard library: the compactMap(_:) operator in Combine removes nil elements in a publisher’s stream and republishes non-nil elements to the downstream subscriber.
The example below uses a range of numbers as the source for a collection based publisher. The compactMap(_:) operator consumes each element from the numbers publisher attempting to access the dictionary using the element as the key. If the example’s dictionary returns a nil, due to a non-existent key, compactMap(_:) filters out the nil (missing) elements.
let numbers = (0...5)
let romanNumeralDict: [Int : String] =
    [1: "I", 2: "II", 3: "III", 5: "V"]


cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .compactMap { romanNumeralDict[$0] }
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


// Prints: "I II III V"

func tryCompactMap<T>((Self.Output) throws -> T?) -> Publishers.TryCompactMap<Self, T>

func removeDuplicates() -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element.
Available when Output conforms to Equatable.
func removeDuplicates(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element, as evaluated by a provided closure.
func tryRemoveDuplicates(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryRemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element, as evaluated by a provided error-throwing closure.
func replaceEmpty(with: Self.Output) -> Publishers.ReplaceEmpty<Self>
Replaces an empty stream with the provided element.
