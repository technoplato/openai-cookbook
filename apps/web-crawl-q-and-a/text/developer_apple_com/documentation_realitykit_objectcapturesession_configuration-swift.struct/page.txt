var checkpointDirectory: URL?
An optional directory to store data about session progress which may be used to speed up on-device reconstruction by passing into the PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration. If you provide a value for checkpointDirectory, it also must point to an empty, writable directory. If the directory is not writable or already contains data, the session moves to the .failed(Error) state.
var isOverCaptureEnabled: Bool
Enables the session to continue capturing even after the number of captured images exceeds maximumNumberOfInputImages. This setting is meant for use when the images are intended to be transferred to macOS for model reconstruction.
