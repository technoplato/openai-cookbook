Discussion
RealityKit automatically creates a default session that the view manages. If you have an existing or custom session, setting it as the view’s session replaces the default session. If you replace the default session, you must start it by calling session.run(_:options:). See automaticallyConfigureSession for more details.
When automaticallyConfigureSession is true, the default value is an ARWorldTrackingConfiguration.
