Instance Method
popover(isPresented:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)
Presents a popover when a given condition is true.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func popover<Content>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    attachmentAnchor: PopoverAttachmentAnchor = .rect(.bounds),
    arrowEdge: Edge = .top,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content
) -> some View where Content : View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the popover content that you return from the modifier’s content closure.
attachmentAnchor
The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover. The default is Anchor/Source/bounds.
arrowEdge
The edge of the attachmentAnchor that defines the location of the popover’s arrow in macOS. The default is Edge/top. iOS ignores this parameter.
content
A closure returning the content of the popover.
Discussion
Use this method to show a popover whose contents are a SwiftUI view that you provide when a bound Boolean variable is true. In the example below, a popover displays whenever the user toggles the isShowingPopover state variable by pressing the “Show Popover” button:
struct PopoverExample: View {
    @State private var isShowingPopover = false


    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Popover") {
            self.isShowingPopover = true
        }
        .popover(isPresented: $isShowingPopover) {
            Text("Popover Content")
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
