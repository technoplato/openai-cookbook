class VNPixelBufferObservation : VNObservation
Overview
This type of observation results from performing a VNCoreMLRequest image analysis with a Core ML model that has an image-to-image processing role. For example, this observation might result from a model that analyzes the style of one image and then transfers that style to a different image.
Vision infers that an MLModel object is an image-to-image model if that model includes an image. Its modelDescription object includes an image-typed feature description in its outputDescriptionsByName dictionary.
Topics
Parsing Observation Content
var pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer
The image that results from a request with image output.
var featureName: String?
A feature name that the CoreML model defines.
