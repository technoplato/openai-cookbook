func tint(_ tint: Color?) -> some View
Parameters
tint
The tint Color to apply.
Discussion
Use this method to override the default accent color for this view. Unlike an app’s accent color, which can be overridden by user preference, the tint color is always respected and should be used as a way to provide additional meaning to the control.
This example shows Answer and Decline buttons with ShapeStyle/green and ShapeStyle/red tint colors, respectively.
struct ControlTint: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Button {
                // Answer the call
            } label: {
                Label("Answer", systemImage: "phone")
            }
            .tint(.green)
            Button {
                // Decline the call
            } label: {
                Label("Decline", systemImage: "phone.down")
            }
            .tint(.red)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
