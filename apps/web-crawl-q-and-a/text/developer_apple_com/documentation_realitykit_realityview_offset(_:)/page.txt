func offset(_ offset: CGSize) -> some View
Parameters
offset
The distance to offset this view.
Return Value
A view that offsets this view by offset.
Discussion
Use offset(_:) to shift the displayed contents by the amount specified in the offset parameter.
The original dimensions of the view aren’t changed by offsetting the contents; in the example below the gray border drawn by this view surrounds the original position of the text:
Text("Offset by passing CGSize()")
    .border(Color.green)
    .offset(CGSize(width: 20, height: 25))
    .border(Color.gray)
