Instance Method
randomElement(using:)
Returns a random element of the collection, using the given generator as a source for randomness.

func randomElement<T>(using generator: inout T) -> Self.Element? where T : RandomNumberGenerator
Parameters
generator
The random number generator to use when choosing a random element.
Return Value
A random element from the collection. If the collection is empty, the method returns nil.
Overview
Call randomElement(using:) to select a random element from an array or another collection when you are using a custom random number generator. This example picks a name at random from an array:
let names = ["Zoey", "Chloe", "Amani", "Amaia"]
let randomName = names.randomElement(using: &myGenerator)!
// randomName == "Amani"
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
Note
The algorithm used to select a random element may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same sequence of elements each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.

func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether every element of a sequence satisfies a given predicate.
var first: Self.Element?
