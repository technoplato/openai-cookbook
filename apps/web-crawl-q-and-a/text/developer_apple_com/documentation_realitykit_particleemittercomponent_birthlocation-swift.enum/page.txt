enum BirthLocation
Topics
Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthLocation, ParticleEmitterComponent.BirthLocation) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case surface
Particles emit from the surface of the shape.
case vertices(count: SIMD3<UInt>)
Particles emit from the vertices of the shape. count is the number of vertices in each direction, the distribution depends on the EmitterShape chosen.
case volume
Particles emit from the internal volume of the shape.
Initializers
init(from: Decoder) throws
Creates a new instance by decoding from the given decoder.
Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
