Topics
Creating a Geometry Instance
init(bounds: BoundingBox, transform: Transform)
Creates an instance with an optional bounding box and transform.
Accessing Geometry Data
var bounds: BoundingBox
The bounding box for the created entity.
var transform: Transform
A transform applied to the created entity.
Comparing Geometry Values
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the enumeration value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two geometry instances aren’t equal.
static func == (PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Geometry, PhotogrammetrySession.Request.Geometry) -> Bool
Indicates whether two geometry instances are equal.
Initializers
init(orientedBounds: OrientedBoundingBox, transform: Transform)
Creates an instance from an oriented bounding box and transform.
Instance Properties
var orientedBounds: OrientedBoundingBox
