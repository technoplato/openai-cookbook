Class
VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest
An image analysis request that finds facial features like eyes and mouth in an image.

iPadOS 11.0+
macOS 10.13+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
tvOS 11.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
class VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest : VNImageBasedRequest
Overview
By default, a face landmarks request first locates all faces in the input image, then analyzes each to detect facial features.
If you’ve already located all the faces in an image, or want to detect landmarks in only a subset of the faces in the image, set the inputFaceObservations property to an array of VNFaceObservation objects representing the faces you want to analyze. You can either use face observations output by a VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest or manually create VNFaceObservation instances with the bounding boxes of the faces you want to analyze.
Topics
