Generic Instance Method
starts(with:by:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.

func starts<PossiblePrefix>(
    with possiblePrefix: PossiblePrefix,
    by areEquivalent: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool
) rethrows -> Bool where PossiblePrefix : Sequence
Parameters
possiblePrefix
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
areEquivalent
A predicate that returns true if its two arguments are equivalent; otherwise, false.
Return Value
true if the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements of possiblePrefix; otherwise, false. If possiblePrefix has no elements, the return value is true.
Discussion
The predicate must be a equivalence relation over the elements. That is, for any elements a, b, and c, the following conditions must hold:
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of possiblePrefix.
areEquivalent(a, a) is always true. (Reflexivity)
areEquivalent(a, b) implies areEquivalent(b, a). (Symmetry)
If areEquivalent(a, b) and areEquivalent(b, c) are both true, then areEquivalent(a, c) is also true. (Transitivity)

Comparing Shaped Array Slices
func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
Returns a comparison result by comparing two shaped array slices.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.
func difference<C>(from: C) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, OtherSequence.Element) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
