Initializer
init(classificationError:confusion:precisionRecall:)
Creates empty classifier metrics.

iPadOS 15.0–17.0 Deprecated
macOS 10.14–14.0 Deprecated
Mac Catalyst 15.0–17.0 Deprecated
tvOS 16.0–17.0 Deprecated

init(
    classificationError: Double,
    confusion: MLDataTable,
    precisionRecall: MLDataTable
)
Parameters
classificationError
The fraction of incorrectly labeled examples.
confusion
A confusion matrix describing the classifications for each category.
precisionRecall
A two-dimensional table describing the precision and recall for each category.
Discussion
You typically don’t initialize metrics directly. Instead you get metrics about your model after training. For example, when you train an MLClassifier, you can look at its trainingMetrics and validationMetrics properties. Additionally, you can check the performance on a test set with the evaluation(on:) method.
Warning
This initializer should not be used, it creates an empty instance.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
