struct ModelComponent
Topics
Creating a Model Component
init(mesh: MeshResource, materials: [Material])
Creates a model component from a mesh and a collection of materials.
Specifying a Mesh
var mesh: MeshResource
The mesh that defines the shape of the entity.
class MeshResource
A high-level representation of a collection of vertices and edges that define a shape.
struct MeshBuffer
Mesh buffer containing elements of any type.
protocol MeshBufferContainer
Conforming objects contain a table of mesh buffers.
protocol MeshBufferSemantic
A protocol that holds an identifier value for mesh buffers.
Configuring the Material
var materials: [Material]
The materials used by the model.
struct SimpleMaterial
A basic material that you can apply to meshes.
struct PhysicallyBasedMaterial
A material that simulates the appearance of real-world objects.
struct CustomMaterial
A material that works with custom Metal shader functions.
struct UnlitMaterial
A simple material that doesn’t respond to lights in the scene.
struct OcclusionMaterial
An invisible material that hides objects rendered behind it.
struct VideoMaterial
A material that supports animated textures.
protocol Material
A type that describes the material aspects of a mesh, like color and texture.
enum MaterialColorParameter
The color parameter applied to a material.
enum MaterialScalarParameter
The scalar parameter applied to a material.
struct MaterialParameterTypes
A set of typesused for material parameters.
Applying Realistic Material and Lighting Effects to Entities
Enhance the appearance of objects in a RealityKit scene with Physically Based Rendering (PBR).
Modifying RealityKit Rendering Using Custom Materials
Write Metal shader functions to implement custom rendering effects.
Registering a Component Type
static func registerComponent()
Registers a new component type.
Modifying the Bounding Box for Rendering
var boundsMargin: Float
A margin applied to an entity’s bounding box that determines object visibility.

3D Models
struct ModelDebugOptionsComponent
A component that changes how RealityKit renders its entity to help with debugging.
struct ModelSortGroupComponent
A component that allows an entity’s models to be rendered in an explicit order relative to the models of other entities in the same sort group. If this component is on an entity, then it must belong to a sort group.
Beta
struct CharacterControllerComponent
A component that manages character movement.
struct CharacterControllerStateComponent
An object that maintains state for a character controller.
