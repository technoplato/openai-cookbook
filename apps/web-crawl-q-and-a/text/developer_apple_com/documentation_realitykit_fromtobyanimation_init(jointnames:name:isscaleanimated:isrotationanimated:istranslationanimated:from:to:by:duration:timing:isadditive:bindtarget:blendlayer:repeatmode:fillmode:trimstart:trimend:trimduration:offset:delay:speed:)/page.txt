init(jointNames:name:isScaleAnimated:isRotationAnimated:isTranslationAnimated:from:to:by:duration:timing:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)
Creates an animation that interpolates between two configurations of the given joints.

Available when Value is JointTransforms.
Parameters
jointNames
The names of the joints in the animated skeletal pose.
name
A unique name for the animation.
Discussion
isScaleAnimated: A Boolean value that indicates whether that animation interpolates changes to the target’s size.
isRotationAnimated: A Boolean value that indicates whether that animation interpolates rotational changes.
isTranslationAnimated: A Boolean value that indicates whether that animation interpolates changes to the target object’s position.
from: The state of the target object’s joints before the animation starts.
to: The state of the target object’s joints after the animation finishes.
by: An amount that increments the animated joints during the animation.
duration: The total playback time.
timing: An option that determines the animation’s pace over time.
isAdditive: A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation blends additively with concurrent animations.
bindTarget: A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
blendLayer: The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.
repeatMode: An option that determines how the animation repeats.
fillMode: The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.
trimStart: The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
trimEnd: The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.
trimDuration: An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
offset: The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
delay: An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
speed: A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
