    allowing target: ARRaycastQuery.Target,
    alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment

Finding Entities at a Point in the View
func entity(at: CGPoint) -> Entity?
Finds the entity in the AR scene closest to the specified point.
func entities(at: CGPoint) -> [Entity]
Finds the collection of entities at the specified point in the scene.
func hitTest(CGPoint, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Searches for objects corresponding to a point in the view based on a query and a collision mask.
func hitTest(CGPoint, types: ARHitTestResult.ResultType) -> [ARHitTestResult]
Searches for objects corresponding to a point in the view based on a set of result types.
func raycast(from: CGPoint, allowing: ARRaycastQuery.Target, alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment) -> [ARRaycastResult]
Performs a ray cast, where a ray is cast into the scene from the center of the camera through a point in the view, and the results are immediately returned.
func trackedRaycast(from: CGPoint, allowing: ARRaycastQuery.Target, alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment, updateHandler: ([ARRaycastResult]) -> Void) -> ARTrackedRaycast?
Performs a tracked ray cast, where a ray is cast into the scene from the center of the camera through a point in the view.
