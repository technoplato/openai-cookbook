Instance Method
convert(normal:to:)
Converts a normal vector from the local space of the entity on which you called this method to the local space of a reference entity.

@MainActor
func convert(
    normal: SIMD3<Float>,
    to referenceEntity: Entity?
) -> SIMD3<Float>
Parameters
normal
A vector perpendicular to a surface at a point, given in the local space of the entity.
referenceEntity
The entity that defines a frame of reference. Set this to nil to indicate world space.
Return Value
The normal vector specified relative to referenceEntity.
