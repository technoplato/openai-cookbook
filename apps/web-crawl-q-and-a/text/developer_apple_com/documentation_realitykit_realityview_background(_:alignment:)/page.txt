func background<Background>(
    _ background: Background,
    alignment: Alignment = .center
) -> some View where Background : View
Parameters
background
The view to draw behind this view.
alignment
The alignment with a default value of Alignment/center that you use to position the background view.
Discussion
Use background(_:alignment:) when you need to place one view behind another, with the background view optionally aligned with a specified edge of the frontmost view.
The example below creates two views: the Frontmost view, and the DiamondBackground view. The Frontmost view uses the DiamondBackground view for the background of the image element inside the Frontmost view’s VStack.
struct DiamondBackground: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Rectangle()
                .fill(.gray)
                .frame(width: 250, height: 250, alignment: .center)
                .rotationEffect(.degrees(45.0))
        }
    }
}


struct Frontmost: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "folder")
                .font(.system(size: 128, weight: .ultraLight))
                .background(DiamondBackground())
        }
    }
}
