Instance Method
raycast(from:allowing:alignment:)
Performs a ray cast, where a ray is cast into the scene from the center of the camera through a point in the view, and the results are immediately returned.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
@MainActor
func raycast(
    from point: CGPoint,
    allowing target: ARRaycastQuery.Target,
    alignment: ARRaycastQuery.TargetAlignment
) -> [ARRaycastResult]
Parameters
point
A point in the view’s local coordinate system.
target
The type of target where the ray should terminate.
alignment
The alignment of the target.
Return Value
A list of ray-cast results, sorted from nearest to farthest from the camera. The list is empty if the ray cast fails.

func hitTest(CGPoint, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Searches for objects corresponding to a point in the view based on a query and a collision mask.
