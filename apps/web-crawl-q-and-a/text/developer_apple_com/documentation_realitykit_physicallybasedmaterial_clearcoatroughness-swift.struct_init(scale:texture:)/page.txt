Initializer
init(scale:texture:)
Creates a clearcoat roughness object using a single value or a texture.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    scale: Float = 1.0,
    texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture? = nil
)
Parameters
scale
The clearcoat roughness value for the entire material.
texture
The clearcoat roughness values as a UV-mapped image.
Discussion
A clearcoat is a separate layer of transparent specular highlights used to simulate a clear transparent coating, like the paint on a car, or the surface of lacquered objects. When you enable clearcoat rendering for a material, RealityKit renders the clearcoat as a separate layer just above the surface of the entity. You can specify a clearcoat roughness value for the clearcoat to indicate how much the clearcoat scatters light that bounces off of it, which softens and spreads out the highlights.
This initializer creates an object that specifies the clearcoat roughness for a material using a single value for the entire material, a UV-mapped image, or both.
If you specify texture, RealityKit calculates the clearcoat roughness for the entity by UV-mapping texture onto the entity and multiplying the value of each mapped pixel by scale. If you don’t specify a texture, then RealityKit uses scale as the entire entity’s clearcoat roughness. If you provide a color image for texture rather than a grayscale image, RealityKit only uses the intensity of the image’s red channel.
