Discussion
The capture quality of the face allows you to compare the quality of the face in terms of its capture attributes: lighting, blur, and prime positioning. Use this value to compare the capture quality of a face against other captures of the same face in a specified set.
The value of this property value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Faces with quality closer to 1.0 are better lit, sharper, and more centrally positioned than faces with quality closer to 0.0.
