func aspectRatio(
    _ aspectRatio: CGSize,
    contentMode: ContentMode
) -> some View
Parameters
aspectRatio
A size that specifies the ratio of width to height to use for the resulting view.
contentMode
A flag indicating whether this view should fit or fill the parent context.
Return Value
A view that constrains this view’s dimensions to aspectRatio, using contentMode as its scaling algorithm.
Discussion
Use aspectRatio(_:contentMode:) to constrain a view’s dimensions to an aspect ratio specified by a doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/CoreGraphics/CGSize.
If this view is resizable, the resulting view uses aspectRatio as its own aspect ratio. In this example, the purple ellipse has a 3:4 width-to-height ratio, and scales to fill its frame:
Ellipse()
    .fill(Color.purple)
    .aspectRatio(CGSize(width: 3, height: 4), contentMode: .fill)
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    .border(Color(white: 0.75))
