Enumeration
TweenMode
Options that determine whether an animation switches between frames gradually or abruptly.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum TweenMode
Overview
This enumeration declares the options for a sampled animation’s tweenMode. The gradual or abrupt change, or interpolation, refers to the visual behavior that occurs between adjacent values in a sampled animation’s frames.
Topics
Choosing a Mode Between Frames
case hold
An option that indicates a keyframe changes to the next abruptly.
case linear
An option that indicates that a keyframe changes to the next gradually.
Comparing Tween Modes
static func == (TweenMode, TweenMode) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the behavior between frames is equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the behavior between frames isn’t equal.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of a value by feeding them into the given hasher.
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
