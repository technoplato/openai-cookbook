In the following example, the .secondDay shipping option is added to the freeOptions option set if purchasePrice is greater than 50.0. For the ShippingOptions declaration, see the OptionSet protocol discussion.
let purchasePrice = 87.55


var freeOptions: ShippingOptions = [.standard, .priority]
if purchasePrice > 50 {
    freeOptions.insert(.secondDay)
