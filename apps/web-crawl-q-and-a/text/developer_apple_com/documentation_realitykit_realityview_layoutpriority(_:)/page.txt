func layoutPriority(_ value: Double) -> some View
Parameters
value
The priority by which a parent layout apportions space to the child.
Discussion
Views typically have a default priority of 0 which causes space to be apportioned evenly to all sibling views. Raising a view’s layout priority encourages the higher priority view to shrink later when the group is shrunk and stretch sooner when the group is stretched.
HStack {
    Text("This is a moderately long string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .border(Color.gray)


    Spacer()


    Text("This is a higher priority string.")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .layoutPriority(1)
        .border(Color.gray)
}
In the example above, the first Text element has the default priority 0 which causes its view to shrink dramatically due to the higher priority of the second Text element, even though all of their other attributes (font, font size and character count) are the same.
A parent layout offers the child views with the highest layout priority all the space offered to the parent minus the minimum space required for all its lower-priority children.
