func listRowSeparatorTint(
    _ color: Color?,
    edges: VerticalEdge.Set = .all
) -> some View
Parameters
color
The color to use to tint the row separators, or nil to use the default color for the current list style.
edges
The set of row edges for which the tint applies. The list style might decide to not display certain separators, typically the top edge. The default is VerticalEdge/Set/all.
Discussion
Separators can be presented above and below a row. You can specify to which edge this preference should apply.
This modifier expresses a preference to the containing List. The list style is the final arbiter for the separator tint.
The following example shows a simple grouped list whose row separators are tinted based on row-specific data:
List {
    ForEach(garage.cars) { car in
        Text(car.model)
            .listRowSeparatorTint(car.brandColor)
    }
}
.listStyle(.grouped)
To hide a row separators, use View/listRowSeparator(_:edges:). To hide or change the tint color for a section separator, use View/listSectionSeparator(_:edges:) and View/listSectionSeparatorTint(_:edges:).
