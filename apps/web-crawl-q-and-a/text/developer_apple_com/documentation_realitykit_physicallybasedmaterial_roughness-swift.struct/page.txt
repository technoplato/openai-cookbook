Structure
PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Roughness
An object that defines the roughness of an entity’s surface.

struct Roughness
Overview
Use this struct to specify the roughness of the entity. The roughness property represents how much the surface of the entity scatters light that it reflects. A material with a high roughness has a matte appearance, whereas one with a low roughness has a shiny appearance.
For more information, see roughness.
Topics
Creating a Roughness Object
init(floatLiteral: Float)
Creates an object from a single value.
init(scale: Float, texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?)
Creates a roughness object from a color or texture.
init(CustomMaterial.Roughness)
Creates a roughness object from a custom material’s roughness property.
Accessing Roughness Data
var texture: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Texture?
The roughness values as a UV-mapped image texture.
static let textureSemantic: TextureResource.Semantic
The intended use of the object’s texture property.
var scale: Float
The roughness value for the entire entity.
typealias FloatLiteralType
An alias for the roughness type that’s appropriate for the current platform.
