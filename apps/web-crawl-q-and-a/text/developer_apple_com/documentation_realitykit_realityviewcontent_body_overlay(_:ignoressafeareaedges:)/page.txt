func overlay<S>(
    _ style: S,
    ignoresSafeAreaEdges edges: Edge.Set = .all
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
style
An instance of a type that conforms to ShapeStyle that SwiftUI layers in front of the modified view.
edges
The set of edges for which to ignore safe area insets when adding the overlay. The default value is Edge/Set/all. Specify an empty set to respect safe area insets on all edges.
Return Value
A view with the specified style drawn in front of it.
Discussion
Use this modifier to layer a type that conforms to the ShapeStyle protocol, like a Color, Material, or HierarchicalShapeStyle, in front of a view. For example, you can overlay the ShapeStyle/ultraThinMaterial over a Circle:
struct CoveredCircle: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
            .overlay(.ultraThinMaterial)
    }
}
SwiftUI anchors the style to the view’s bounds. For the example above, the overlay fills the entirety of the circle’s frame (which happens to be wider than the circle is tall):
SwiftUI also limits the style’s extent to the view’s container-relative shape. You can see this effect if you constrain the CoveredCircle view with a View/containerShape(_:) modifier:
CoveredCircle()
    .containerShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 30))
The overlay takes on the specified container shape:
By default, the overlay ignores safe area insets on all edges, but you can provide a specific set of edges to ignore, or an empty set to respect safe area insets on all edges:
Rectangle()
    .overlay(
        .secondary,
        ignoresSafeAreaEdges: []) // Ignore no safe area insets.
If you want to specify a View or a stack of views as the overlay rather than a style, use View/overlay(alignment:content:) instead. If you want to specify a Shape, use View/overlay(_:in:fillStyle:).
