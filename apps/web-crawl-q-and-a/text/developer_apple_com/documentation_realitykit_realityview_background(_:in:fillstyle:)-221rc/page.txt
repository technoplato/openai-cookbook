func background<S, T>(
    _ style: S,
    in shape: T,
    fillStyle: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle, T : InsettableShape
Parameters
style
A ShapeStyle that SwiftUI uses to the fill the shape that you specify.
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to InsettableShape that SwiftUI draws behind the view.
fillStyle
The FillStyle to use when drawing the shape. The default style uses the nonzero winding number rule and antialiasing.
Return Value
A view with the specified insettable shape drawn behind it.
Discussion
Use this modifier to layer a type that conforms to the InsettableShape protocol — like a Rectangle, Circle, or Capsule — behind a view. Specify the ShapeStyle that’s used to fill the shape. For example, you can place a RoundedRectangle behind a Label:
Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
    .padding()
    .background(.teal, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
The ShapeStyle/teal color fills the shape:
This modifier and View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j are convenience methods for placing a single shape behind a view. To create a background with other View types — or with a stack of views — use View/background(alignment:content:) instead. To add a ShapeStyle as a background, use View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:).
