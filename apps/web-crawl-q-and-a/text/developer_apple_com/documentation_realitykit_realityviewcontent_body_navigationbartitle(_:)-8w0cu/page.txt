Discussion
Use navigationBarTitle(_:) to set the title of the navigation bar using a String. This modifier only takes effect when this view is inside of and visible within a NavigationView.
In the example below, text for the navigation bar title is provided using a string:
struct FlavorView: View {
    let items = ["Chocolate", "Vanilla", "Strawberry", "Mint Chip",
                 "Pistachio"]
    let text = "Today's Flavors"
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(items, id: \.self) {
                Text($0)
            }
            .navigationBarTitle(text)
        }
    }
}
