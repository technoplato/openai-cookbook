func dropLast(_ k: Int = 1) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
k
The number of elements to drop off the end of the collection. k must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence that leaves off the specified number of elements at the end.
Discussion
If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result is an empty subsequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.dropLast(2))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3]"
print(numbers.dropLast(10))
// Prints "[]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
