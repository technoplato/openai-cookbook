struct MaterialParameterTypes
Overview
This class contains many nested types used to specify various properties of material.
Many material properties support more than one type of data. For example, you can specify baseColor using either a single Float, or a UV mapped image texture. MaterialParameterTypes and its nested symbols implement the ability to accept different data types for the same property.
Topics
