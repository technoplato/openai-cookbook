func lineLimit(_ limit: PartialRangeThrough<Int>) -> some View
Parameters
limit
The line limit.
Discussion
Use this modifier to specify a partial range of lines that a Text view or a vertical TextField can occupy. When the text of such views occupies more space than the provided limit, a Text view truncates its content while a TextField becomes scrollable.
Form {
    TextField("Title", text: $model.title)
    TextField("Notes", text: $model.notes, axis: .vertical)
        .lineLimit(...3)
}
Note
This modifier is equivalent to the View/lineLimit(_:)-513mb modifier taking just an integer.
