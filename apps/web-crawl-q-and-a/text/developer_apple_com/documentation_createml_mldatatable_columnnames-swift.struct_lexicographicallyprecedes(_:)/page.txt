Instance Method
lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (<) to compare elements.

iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+

Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(_ other: OtherSequence) -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, Self.Element == OtherSequence.Element
Available when Element conforms to Comparable.
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
Return Value
true if this sequence precedes other in a dictionary ordering; otherwise, false.
Discussion
This example uses the lexicographicallyPrecedes method to test which array of integers comes first in a lexicographical ordering.
let a = [1, 2, 2, 2]
let b = [1, 2, 3, 4]


print(a.lexicographicallyPrecedes(b))
// Prints "true"
print(b.lexicographicallyPrecedes(b))
// Prints "false"
Note
This method implements the mathematical notion of lexicographical ordering, which has no connection to Unicode. If you are sorting strings to present to the end user, use String APIs that perform localized comparison.
Complexity
O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
