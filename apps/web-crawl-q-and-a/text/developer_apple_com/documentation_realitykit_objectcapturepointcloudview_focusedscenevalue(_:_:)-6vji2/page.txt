Instance Method

Creates a new view that exposes the provided value to other views whose state depends on the active scene.

func focusedSceneValue<T>(
    _ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<FocusedValues, T?>,
    _ value: T?
) -> some View
Parameters
keyPath
The key path to associate value with when adding it to the existing table of published focus values.
value
The focus value to publish, or nil if no value is currently available.
Return Value
A modified representation of this view.
Discussion
Use this method instead of View/focusedValue(_:_:) for values that must be visible regardless of where focus is located in the active scene. For example, if an app needs a command for moving focus to a particular text field in the sidebar, it could use this modifier to publish a button action that’s visible to command views as long as the scene is active, and regardless of where focus happens to be in it.
struct Sidebar: View {
    @FocusState var isFiltering: Bool


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField(...)
                .focused(when: $isFiltering)
                .focusedSceneValue(\.filterAction) {
                    isFiltering = true
                }
        }
    }
}


struct NavigationCommands: Commands {
    @FocusedValue(\.filterAction) var filterAction


    var body: some Commands {
        CommandMenu("Navigate") {
            Button("Filter in Sidebar") {
                filterAction?()
            }
        }
        .disabled(filterAction == nil)
    }
}


struct FilterActionKey: FocusedValuesKey {
    typealias Value = () -> Void
}


extension FocusedValues {
    var filterAction: (() -> Void)? {
        get { self[FilterActionKey.self] }
        set { self[FilterActionKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}
