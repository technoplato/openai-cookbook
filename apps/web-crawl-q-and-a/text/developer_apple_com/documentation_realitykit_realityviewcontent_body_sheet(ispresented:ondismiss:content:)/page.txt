Discussion
Use this method when you want to present a modal view to the user when a Boolean value you provide is true. The example below displays a modal view of the mockup for a software license agreement when the user toggles the isShowingSheet variable by clicking or tapping on the “Show License Agreement” button:
struct ShowLicenseAgreement: View {
    @State private var isShowingSheet = false
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            isShowingSheet.toggle()
        }) {
            Text("Show License Agreement")
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $isShowingSheet,
               onDismiss: didDismiss) {
            VStack {
                Text("License Agreement")
                    .font(.title)
                    .padding(50)
                Text("""
                        Terms and conditions go here.
                    """)
                    .padding(50)
                Button("Dismiss",
                       action: { isShowingSheet.toggle() })
            }
        }
    }


    func didDismiss() {
        // Handle the dismissing action.
    }
}
In vertically compact environments, such as iPhone in landscape orientation, a sheet presentation automatically adapts to appear as a full-screen cover. Use the View/presentationCompactAdaptation(_:) or View/presentationCompactAdaptation(horizontal:vertical:) modifier to override this behavior.
