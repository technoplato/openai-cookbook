Structures
struct CollisionOptions
Operators
static func == (PhysicsSimulationComponent, PhysicsSimulationComponent) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init()
Instance Properties
var clock: CMClockOrTimebase
A custom clock which drives the physics simulation, defaults to the engine clock.
var collisionOptions: PhysicsSimulationComponent.CollisionOptions
Enables or disables kinematic collision reporting.
var gravity: SIMD3<Float>
Gravity for the simulation relative to the simulation entity. Defaults to -9.81.
Type Methods
static func nearestSimulationEntity(for: Entity) -> Entity?
Returns the entity containing the physics simulation origin. The simulation origin is the nearest parent where either a PhysicsSimulationComponent exists, or the root entity (normally the anchor) where the default simulation is rooted. Returns nil if the entity is not parented in the scene.

Simulations
struct CollisionComponent
A component that gives an entity the ability to collide with other entities that also have collision components.
struct PhysicsBodyComponent
A component that defines an entity’s behavior in physics body simulations.
struct PhysicsMotionComponent
A component that controls the motion of the body in physics simulations.
struct ParticleEmitterComponent
Beta
struct PerspectiveCameraComponent
In AR applications, the camera is automatically provided by the system. In non-AR scenarios, the camera needs to be set by the app. (If no camera is provided by the app, the system will use default camera.)
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
