Generic Instance Method
elementsEqual(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
Xcode 13.0+
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(_ other: OtherSequence) -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar> == OtherSequence.Element
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
Return Value
true if this sequence and other contain the same elements in the same order.
Discussion
At least one of the sequences must be finite.
This example tests whether one countable range shares the same elements as another countable range and an array.
let a = 1...3
let b = 1...10


print(a.elementsEqual(b))
// Prints "false"
print(a.elementsEqual([1, 2, 3]))
// Prints "true"
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.

func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
Returns a comparison result by comparing two shaped array slices.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.
func difference<C>(from: C) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, OtherSequence.Element) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, PossiblePrefix.Element) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
