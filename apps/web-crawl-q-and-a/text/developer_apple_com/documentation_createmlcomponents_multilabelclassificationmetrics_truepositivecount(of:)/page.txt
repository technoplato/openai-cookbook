func truePositiveCount(of label: Label) -> Int
Available when Label conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
label
The label to use as true positive.
Return Value
The true positive count.
Discussion
If the label does not have a confidence threshold, the true positive count is number of elements in the ground truth labels collection that contains the label. If the label has a confidence threshold NaN, the true positive count is 0. If the label is not in the known set of labels, the true positive count is 0.
