struct ComposedTransformer<Inner, Outer> where Inner : Transformer, Outer : Transformer, Inner.Output == Outer.Input
Overview
The inner transformer’s output must match the outer transformer input. The result of this transformer is equivalent to invoking outer(inner(x)) on an input x,
Topics
Creating the Transformer
init(Inner, Outer)
Creates a transformer composition from two transformers.
Getting the Properties
var inner: Inner
The inner transformer.
var outer: Outer
The outer transformer.
Performing the Transformation
typealias Input
The input type.
typealias Intermediate
The intermediate type.
typealias Output
The output type.
Instance Methods
func applied(to: ComposedTransformer<Inner, Outer>.Input, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> ComposedTransformer<Inner, Outer>.Output
Performs the composed transformation on a single input.
