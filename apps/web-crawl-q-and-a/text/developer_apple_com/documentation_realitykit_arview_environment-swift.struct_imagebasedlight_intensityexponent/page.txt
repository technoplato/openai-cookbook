Discussion
An intensity factor is computed as `2^```ARView/Environment-swift.struct/ImageBasedLight/intensityExponent``. The computed value modulates the native value specified in the diffuse and specular textures.
Set the intensityExponent to 0—corresponding to a scale factor of 1—to use the unmodified diffuse and specular intensities, as specified in the texture.
Current page is intensityExponent
