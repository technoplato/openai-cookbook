Structure
SampledAnimation
An animation that cycles through a series of frames at a constant interval.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct SampledAnimation<Value> where Value : AnimatableData
Overview
To specify the data that the animation samples, set one of the frames properties that matches the animated property’s type. For example, set the frames property to interpolate Float values.
The following code designates a SampledAnimation to animate a propery of type Float by specifying the generic typed syntax. The code queues an array of values: 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.
// Define the animation type.
typealias SampledAnimationType = SampledAnimation<Float>


// Define the animated property values.
let frameArray: [Float] = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
To determine how fast the animation progresses from frame to frame, define this structure’s frameInterval property. The following code specifies a one-second delay between value changes before initializing the animation object.
// Define a one-second frame interval.
let interval = TimeInterval(1.0)


// Create the animation. let sampleAnim = SampledAnimationType.init(
    frames: frameArray,
    name: "sampledAnim1",
    frameInterval: interal
    isAdditive: true,
    bindTarget: .transform,
    blendLayer: 100,
    repeatMode: .autoReverse,
    fillMode: .backwards,
    trimStart: 1.0,
    trimEnd: 10.0,
    trimDuration: 9.0,
    offset: 2.0,
    delay: 1.0,
    speed: 2.0)

Creating an Animation
init(frames: [Value], name: String, tweenMode: TweenMode, frameInterval: Float, isAdditive: Bool, bindTarget: BindTarget?, blendLayer: Int32, repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode, fillMode: AnimationFillMode, trimStart: TimeInterval?, trimEnd: TimeInterval?, trimDuration: TimeInterval?, offset: TimeInterval, delay: TimeInterval, speed: Float)
Creates an animation with a collection of frames that represent incremental steps in the overall timeline.
init(jointNames: [String], frames: [Value], name: String, tweenMode: TweenMode, frameInterval: Float, isAdditive: Bool, isScaleAnimated: Bool, isRotationAnimated: Bool, isTranslationAnimated: Bool, bindTarget: BindTarget?, blendLayer: Int32, repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode, fillMode: AnimationFillMode, trimStart: TimeInterval?, trimEnd: TimeInterval?, trimDuration: TimeInterval?, offset: TimeInterval, delay: TimeInterval, speed: Float)
Creates an animation that interpolates between two configurations of the given joints.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
Configuring the Animation
var name: String
A textual name for the animation.
var bindTarget: BindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
var blendLayer: Int32
The order in which the framework composites the animation.
var jointNames: [String]
The names of the joints to animate.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isRotationAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation observes rotational changes in the entity’s transform.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isScaleAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation observes changes in the entity’s size.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var isTranslationAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation observes translational changes in the entity’s transform.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var additive: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
var tweenMode: TweenMode
An option that determines how animation frames transition.
Defining Frames Data
var frames: [JointTransforms]
An array of joint transforms in which each element represents a discrete state of the target entity at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var frames: [Transform]
An array of transforms in which each element represents a discrete state of the target entity at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is Transform.
var frames: [Double]
An array of double-precision values in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is Double.
var frames: [Float]
An array of floating-point values in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is Float.
var frames: [simd_quatf]
An array of quaternions in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is simd_quatf.
var frames: [SIMD2<Float>]
An array of floating-point pairs in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is SIMD2<Float>.
var frames: [SIMD3<Float>]
An array of floating-point triplets in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is SIMD3<Float>.
var frames: [SIMD4<Float>]
An array of floating-point quadruples in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
Available when Value is SIMD4<Float>.
Timing the Animation
var frameInterval: Float
The duration within the animation timeline for each frame in the frames array.
var start: TimeInterval
An integer multiple of the frame interval at which the animation plays.
var end: TimeInterval
An integer multiple of the frame interval at which the animation stops.
var speed: Float
A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
var delay: TimeInterval
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
var duration: TimeInterval
The total playback time of the animation.
var offset: TimeInterval
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
var trimDuration: TimeInterval?
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
var trimStart: TimeInterval?
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
var trimEnd: TimeInterval?
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.
func trimmed(start: TimeInterval?, end: TimeInterval?, duration: TimeInterval?) -> Self
Edits the animation duration according to the specified time.
Repeating Animation Playback
var repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
var fillMode: AnimationFillMode
An option that determines which data displays outside of the normal duration.
func repeated(count: TimeInterval) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by an irrational number.
func repeated(count: Int) -> Self
Repeats an animation the number of times specified by a whole number.
func repeatingForever() -> Self
Repeats the animation infinitely.
