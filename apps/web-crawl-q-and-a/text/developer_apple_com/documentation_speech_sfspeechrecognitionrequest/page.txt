Overview
Don’t create SFSpeechRecognitionRequest objects directly. Create an SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest or SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest object instead. Use the properties of this class to configure various aspects of your request object before you start the speech recognition process. For example, use the shouldReportPartialResults property to specify whether you want partial results or only the final result of speech recognition.
