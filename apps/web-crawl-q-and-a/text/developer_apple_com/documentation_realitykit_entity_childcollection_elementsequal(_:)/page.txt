Instance Method
elementsEqual(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(_ other: OtherSequence) -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, Self.Element == OtherSequence.Element
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
other
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
Return Value
true if this sequence and other contain the same elements in the same order.
Overview
At least one of the sequences must be finite.
This example tests whether one countable range shares the same elements as another countable range and an array.
let a = 1...3
let b = 1...10


print(a.elementsEqual(b))
// Prints "false"
print(a.elementsEqual([1, 2, 3]))
// Prints "true"
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of other.

Comparing Collections
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
