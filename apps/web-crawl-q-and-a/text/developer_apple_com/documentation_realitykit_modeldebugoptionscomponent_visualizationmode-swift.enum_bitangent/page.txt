Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of bitangent to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw that entity’s calculated surface bitangent vectors as its surface color. A bitangent vector is an imaginary line that’s orthagonal to both the normal and tangent vectors. RealityKit draws a bitangent vector by using its X, Y, and Z values as the R, G, and B components of the color.
RealityKit calculates bitangents for entities with a VideoMaterial, UnlitMaterial, or SimpleMaterial as well as for entities imported from a USDZ file. If an entity doesn’t fall within those parameters, this option has no effect on the rendering.
Here’s how to enable bitangent visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .bitangent)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```


![A screenshot showing two virtual TVs from an AR app. The TV on the
left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right uses a tangent visualization, and appears in shades of
yellow, purples, pinks, and blues, which is a graphical
representation of the calculated surface bitangent vector at each
point on the TV’s
surface.](ModelDebugOptionsComponent-VisualizationMode-swift-enum-bitangent-1)
