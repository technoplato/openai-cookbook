Instance Property
requiresOnDeviceRecognition
A Boolean value that determines whether a request must keep its audio data on the device.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var requiresOnDeviceRecognition: Bool { get set }
Discussion
Set this property to true to prevent an SFSpeechRecognitionRequest from sending audio over the network. However, on-device requests won’t be as accurate.
Note
The request only honors this setting if the supportsOnDeviceRecognition (SFSpeechRecognizer) property is also true.
