func falseNegativeCount(of label: Label) -> Int
Available when Label conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
label
The label to use as true positive.
Return Value
The false negative count.
Discussion
If the label does not have a confidence threshold, the false negative count is 0. If the label has a confidence threshold NaN, the false negative count is the number of elements in the ground truth labels collection that do not contain the label. If the label is not in the known set of labels, the false negative count is 0.
Beta Software
