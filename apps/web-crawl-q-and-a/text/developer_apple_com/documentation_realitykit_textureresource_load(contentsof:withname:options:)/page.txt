Loads a texture resource from a URL with options.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
static func load(
    contentsOf url: URL,
    withName resourceName: String? = nil,
    options: TextureResource.CreateOptions
) throws -> TextureResource
Parameters
url
The URL of the resource.
resourceName
A unique name to assign to the loaded resource, for use in network synchronization.
options
Configuration options for texture creation.
Return Value
The loaded resource.
Discussion
This method loads the image specified by the URL and creates a texture resource from it. This method blocks until it has loaded the image and created the texture resource.
RealityKit uses the resource name to identify resources, and to match texture resources between networked peers. Specify a unique name for each texture resource you load or generate.
