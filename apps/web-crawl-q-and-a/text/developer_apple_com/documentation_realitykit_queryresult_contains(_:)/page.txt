Instance Method
contains(_:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
RealityKit

func contains(_ element: Self.Element) -> Bool
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
element
The element to find in the sequence.
Return Value
true if the element was found in the sequence; otherwise, false.
Overview
This example checks to see whether a favorite actor is in an array storing a movie’s cast.
let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
print(cast.contains("Marlon"))
// Prints "true"
print(cast.contains("James"))
// Prints "false"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.

func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
