Swift
Instance Method
compactMap(_:)
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
RealityKit

Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>(_ transform: (Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Parameters
transform
A closure that accepts an element of this sequence as its argument and returns an optional value.
Return Value
An array of the non-nil results of calling transform with each element of the sequence.
Overview
Use this method to receive an array of non-optional values when your transformation produces an optional value.
In this example, note the difference in the result of using map and compactMap with a transformation that returns an optional Int value.
let possibleNumbers = ["1", "2", "three", "///4///", "5"]


let mapped: [Int?] = possibleNumbers.map { str in Int(str) }
// [1, 2, nil, nil, 5]


let compactMapped: [Int] = possibleNumbers.compactMap { str in Int(str) }
// [1, 2, 5]
Complexity: O(m + n), where n is the length of this sequence and m is the length of the result.

func map<T>((Self.Element) throws -> T) rethrows -> [T]
Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> SegmentOfResult) rethrows -> [SegmentOfResult.Element]
Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) throws -> ()) rethrows -> Result
Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
var lazy: LazySequence<Self>
A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as map and filter, are implemented lazily.
func flatMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) throws -> ElementOfResult?) rethrows -> [ElementOfResult]
Returns an array containing the non-nil results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
