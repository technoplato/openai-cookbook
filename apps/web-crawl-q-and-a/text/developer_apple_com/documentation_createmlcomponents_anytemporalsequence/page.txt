init<S>(S)
init<S>(S, count: Int?)
Getting the Properties
let count: Int?
The number of elements in the sequence if available, calculated nondestructively.
Making the Iterator
func makeAsyncIterator() -> AnyTemporalIterator<AnyTemporalSequence<Feature>.Element>
Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.
typealias AsyncIterator
The type of asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.
typealias Element
The type of element produced by this asynchronous sequence.
