Discussion
RealityKit applies a high dynamic range effect, along with tone mapping, as a post-processing step in the GPU during the render. This effect is computationally inexpensive, but you can add the disableHDR option to the view’s renderOptions set to turn the effect off, if needed. Disabling the effect is most useful on older devices, like those with an A9 processor or earlier.
When deciding whether to use any effect, be sure to consider your app’s CPU and GPU utilization, as described in Improving the Performance of a RealityKit App.
