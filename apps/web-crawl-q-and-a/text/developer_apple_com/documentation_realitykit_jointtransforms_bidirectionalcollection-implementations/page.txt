Instance Properties
var last: Self.Element?
The last joint transform in the collection.
Instance Methods
func difference<C>(from: C) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Provides all the elements that differ across this collection and another.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, Self.Element) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<Self.Element>
Provides all the elements that differ across this collection and another according to the given closure.
func distance(from: Self.Index, to: Self.Index) -> Int
Returns the distance between two indices.
func dropLast(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Provides a subsequence containing all but the given number of trailing elements.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int) -> Self.Index
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func last(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the last element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func lastIndex(of: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
Returns the last index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func lastIndex(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index?
Returns the index of the last element in the collection that matches the given predicate.
func reversed() -> ReversedCollection<Self>
Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.
func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.
