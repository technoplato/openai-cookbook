var hasPrecisionRecallCurve: Bool { get }
Discussion
Precision refers to the percentage of your classification results that are relevant, while recall refers to the percentage of total relevant results correctly classified.
If this property is true, then you can call precision and recall-related methods in this observation. If this property is false, then the precision and recall-related methods won't return meaningful data.
