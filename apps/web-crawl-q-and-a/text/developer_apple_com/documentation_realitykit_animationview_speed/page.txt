Instance Property
speed
A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.
iOS 15.0+

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var speed: Float { get set }
Discussion
The default value is 1.0, which doesn’t alter the animation’s duration. A value of 2.0 indicates that the duration is half the underlying setting. A value of 0.5 indicates that the duration is twice the underlying setting. Negative values play the animation in reverse.
This property doesn’t affect the animation’s delay.

var trimDuration: TimeInterval?
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
var trimStart: TimeInterval?
The time, in seconds, at which the source animation plays.
var trimEnd: TimeInterval?
