@preconcurrency
func prefix(while predicate: @escaping (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element as a parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the modified sequence.
Return Value
An asynchronous sequence of the initial, consecutive elements that satisfy predicate.
Overview
Use prefix(while:) to produce values while elements from the base sequence meet a condition you specify. The modified sequence ends when the predicate closure returns false.
In this example, an asynchronous sequence called Counter produces Int values from 1 to 10. The prefix(while:) method causes the modified sequence to pass along values so long as they aren’t divisible by 2 and 3. Upon reaching 6, the sequence ends:
let stream = Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .prefix { $0 % 2 != 0 || $0 % 3 != 0 }
for try await number in stream {
    print("\(number) ", terminator: " ")
}
// prints "1  2  3  4  5"

Filtering the Output
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfies the given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence<Self>
Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence<Self>
Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence<Self>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.
