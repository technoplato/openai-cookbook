Structure
BlendTreeBlendNode
A source node for an animation that mixes several animations to form a single animation.

struct BlendTreeBlendNode
Overview
A blend tree animation mixes multiple animations to form a single animation. The BlendTreeBlendNode structure adopts the BlendTreeNode protocol, which specifies the behavior of animations that make up a blend tree animation. This structure adds the ability to branch a blend tree at any point. Each member of this property’s sources array represents a branch in the tree. For more information about blend trees, see BlendTreeAnimation.
Topics
Creating a Blend-Tree Blend Node
init(sources: [BlendTreeNode], name: String, weight: BlendWeight, isAdditive: Bool)
Creates a tree node made up of multiple branches.
Configuring the Node
var name: String
A textual name for the blend node.
var weight: BlendWeight
A normalized percentage that designates how much effect this node has compared to peer nodes.
var isAdditive: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
Configuring Child Nodes
var sources: [BlendTreeNode]
The nodes that branch from a node to form part of a blend tree.
