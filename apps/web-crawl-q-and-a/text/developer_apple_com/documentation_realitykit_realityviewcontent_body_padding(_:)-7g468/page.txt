func padding(_ length: CGFloat) -> some View
Parameters
length
The amount, given in points, to pad this view on all edges.
Return Value
A view that’s padded by the amount you specify.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add padding all the way around a view.
VStack {
    Text("Text padded by 10 points on each edge.")
        .padding(10)
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The order in which you apply modifiers matters. The example above applies the padding before applying the border to ensure that the border encompasses the padded region:
To independently control the amount of padding for each edge, use View/padding(_:)-6pgqq. To pad a select set of edges by the same amount, use View/padding(_:_:).
