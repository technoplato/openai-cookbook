@MainActor
func replace(
    withImage cgImage: CGImage,
    options: TextureResource.CreateOptions
) throws
Parameters
cgImage
The source image.
options
Options that specify the type of texture to create.
Discussion
This method blocks until the resource updates. Do not use this method for framerate updates. For frequent texture changes, see replace(withDrawables:). If a TextureResource.DrawableQueue has been attached to this resource, this function detaches it.
To ensure consistent usage of this texture resource, pass the same semantic in options that you used to create the resource.
Note
The contents of a modified texture resource are not synced between network clients.
