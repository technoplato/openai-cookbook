func replaceEmpty(with output: Self.Output) -> Publishers.ReplaceEmpty<Self>
Parameters
output
An element to emit when the upstream publisher finishes without emitting any elements.
Return Value
A publisher that replaces an empty stream with the provided output element.
Discussion
Use replaceEmpty(with:) to provide a replacement element if the upstream publisher finishes without producing any elements.
In the example below, the empty Double array publisher doesn’t produce any elements, so replaceEmpty(with:) publishes Double.nan and finishes normally.
let numbers: [Double] = []
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .replaceEmpty(with: Double.nan)
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


// Prints "(nan)".
Conversely, providing a non-empty publisher publishes all elements and the publisher then terminates normally:
let otherNumbers: [Double] = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
cancellable2 = otherNumbers.publisher
    .replaceEmpty(with: Double.nan)
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


// Prints: 1.0 2.0 3.0

func tryFilter((Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryFilter<Self>
Republishes all elements that match a provided error-throwing closure.
func compactMap<T>((Self.Output) -> T?) -> Publishers.CompactMap<Self, T>
Calls a closure with each received element and publishes any returned optional that has a value.
func tryCompactMap<T>((Self.Output) throws -> T?) -> Publishers.TryCompactMap<Self, T>
Calls an error-throwing closure with each received element and publishes any returned optional that has a value.
func removeDuplicates() -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element.
Available when Output conforms to Equatable.
func removeDuplicates(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.RemoveDuplicates<Self>
Publishes only elements that don’t match the previous element, as evaluated by a provided closure.
