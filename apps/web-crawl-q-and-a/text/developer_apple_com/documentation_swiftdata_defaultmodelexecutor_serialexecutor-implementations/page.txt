Instance Methods

Convert this executor value to the optimized form of borrowed executor references.
Beta
func assertIsolated(() -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)
Performs an executor check in debug builds.
Beta
func enqueue(ExecutorJob)
Beta
func isSameExclusiveExecutionContext(other: Self) -> Bool
If this executor has complex equality semantics, and the runtime needs to compare two executors, it will first attempt the usual pointer-based equality check, and if it fails it will compare the types of both executors, if they are the same, it will finally invoke this method, in an attempt to let the executor itself decide if this and the other executor represent the same serial, exclusive, isolation context.
Beta
func preconditionIsolated(() -> String, file: StaticString, line: UInt)
Unconditionally if the current task is executing on the expected serial executor, and if not crash the program offering information about the executor mismatch.
