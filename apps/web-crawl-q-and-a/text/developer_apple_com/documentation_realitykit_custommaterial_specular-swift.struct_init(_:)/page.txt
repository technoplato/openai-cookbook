Discussion
This initializer creates an object by copying the values from an existing PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Specular object.
RealityKit automatically draws specular highlights for physically based materials using the values of various properties, primarily roughness and metallic. Specular highlights are bright spots of reflected light that appear on shiny objects.
While many real-world objects can be accurately and realistically simulated with just the core physically based rendering (PBR) properties, you can create additional realistic effects by augmenting the specular highlights.
The specular scale and texture values are available to the material’s surface shader, but RealityKit doesn’t add specular highlights unless the surface shader function calls params.surface().set_specular().
The following Metal code demonstrates using the specular scale and texture values in a surface shader function to calculate additional specular highlights, emulating the behavior of PhysicallyBasedMaterial:
    // Retrieve the opacity scale from the CustomMaterial.
    float specularScale = params.material_constants().specular_scale();


    // Retrieve the entity's texture coordinates.
    float2 uv = params.geometry().uv0();


    // Entities loaded from a USDZ or .reality file use texture coordinates
    // with a flipped y-axis. This compensates for that.
    uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;


    // Sample the specular texture.
    auto tex = params.textures();
    half specular = tex.specular().sample(textureSampler, uv).r;


    // Multiply the tint and the sampled value from the texture, and
    // assign the result.
    specular *= specularScale;
    params.surface().set_specular(specular);
value: The specular property from a PhysicallyBasedMaterial.
