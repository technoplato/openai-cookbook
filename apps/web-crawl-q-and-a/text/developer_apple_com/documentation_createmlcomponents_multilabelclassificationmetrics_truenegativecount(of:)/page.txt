func trueNegativeCount(of label: Label) -> Int
Available when Label conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
label
The label to use as true positive.
Return Value
The true negative count.
Discussion
If the label does not have a confidence threshold, the true negative count is 0. If the label has a confidence threshold NaN, the true negative count is the number elements in the ground truth collection that do not contain the label. If the label is not in the known set of labels, the true negative count is 0.
