Discussion
This may indicate that sections of the reconstructed model (such as the bottom after a flip) are incomplete. This may occur if a non-rigid object is flipped such that its shape subtly changes before and after the flip or if an object is shiny and lighting causes highlight changes across a flip. It is recommended that users are reminded of proper object and environment selection if this message is output, and that they check their model for potential issues.
