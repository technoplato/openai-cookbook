Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of specular to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw the entity’s calculated specularity as its surface color. RealityKit uses specular to calculate bright highlights caused by shiny surfaces reflecting light. RealityKit draws the specularity value as a grayscale value from black (0.0) to white (1.0).
Note
In most cases, RealityKit calculates specular highlights based on an entity’s roughness and metallic values, and not its specular value, which is usually 0.0. As a result, this mode causes most entities to render in solid black. Only entities that need highlights in addition to the ones RealityKit calculates from roughness and metallic need specular values greater than zero. Examples of entities that might use specular to create supplemental highlights are gemstones and cut glass.
RealityKit calculates specularity for entities with a SimpleMaterial and for entities imported from a USDZ file. For other entities, this option has no effect.
Here’s how to enable ambient occlusion visualization for an entity:
    if let television = anchor.findEntity(named: "Television")
        as? ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .specular)
    television.modelDebugOptions = component
} ```


![A screenshot showing two virtual TVs from an AR app. The TV on the
left uses no debug visualizations, and renders as an old-fashioned
television displaying a multicolored test pattern. It is drawn with
shadows and highlights to appear as realistic as possible. The TV on
the right is drawn in shades of white and gray which is a graphical
representation of the TV’s specular values.
