@MainActor
func addForce(
    _ force: SIMD3<Float>,
    at position: SIMD3<Float>,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
force
A force in newtons.
position
The position at which to apply the force.
Discussion
The physics simulator applies the added force until the end of the frame interval. To continue exerting the force after that time, add the force again with another call to the method. Handle the SceneEvents.Update event to receive an indication of when the frame interval ends. For an app that renders at 60 frames per second (fps), this event occurs about once per 16 milliseconds.
referenceEntity: The reference entity that defines the coordinate space in which position and force are defined.

func addTorque(SIMD3<Float>, relativeTo: Entity?)
Applies a torque to the physics body at its center of mass.
func clearForcesAndTorques()
Clears all forces previously added to the physics body.
