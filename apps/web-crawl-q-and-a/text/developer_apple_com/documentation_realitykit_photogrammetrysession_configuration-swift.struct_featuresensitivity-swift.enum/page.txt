Topics
Specifying Feature Sensitivity
case normal
The session uses the default algorithm to detect landmarks.
case high
The session uses a slower, more sensitive algorithm to detect landmarks.
Comparing Values
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the enumeration value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two enumeration values aren’t equal.
static func == (PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.FeatureSensitivity, PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.FeatureSensitivity) -> Bool
Indicates whether two enumeration values are equal.
