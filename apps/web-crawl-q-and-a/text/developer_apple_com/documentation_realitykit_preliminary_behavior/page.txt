Preliminary_Behavior
A typed schema that combines one or more triggers with associated actions.
Overview
Because it inherits Typed, this schema declares a Preliminary_Behavior as a type of prim. For more information about typed schemas, see USD Specification > Typed.
To run actions based on a trigger, an asset defines a prim of this type and sets its triggers and actions.
Declaration
class Preliminary_Behavior "Preliminary_Behavior" (
    inherits = </Typed>
)
Trigger Animation for a Tapped Cube
The following example demonstrates a behavior that applies an EmphasizeAction to a cube to flip it. Because the cube defines a tap trigger, the runtime performs the flip when a user taps the cube in an AR experience.
#usda 1.0


def Preliminary_Behavior "TapAndFlip"
{
    rel triggers = [ <Tap> ]
    rel actions = [ <Entry> ]


    def Preliminary_Trigger "Tap" ( inherits = </TapGestureTrigger> )
    {
        rel affectedObjects = [ </Cube> ]
    }


    def Preliminary_Action "Entry" ( inherits = </GroupAction> )
    {
        uniform token type = "parallel"
        rel actions = [ <Flip> ]
    }


    def Preliminary_Action "Flip" ( inherits = </EmphasizeAction> )
    {
        rel affectedObjects = [ </Cube> ]
        uniform token motionType = "flip"
    }
}


def Cube "Cube" { }
