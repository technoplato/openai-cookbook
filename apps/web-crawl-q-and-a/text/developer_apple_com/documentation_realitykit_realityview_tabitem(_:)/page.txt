Discussion
Use tabItem(_:) to configure a view as a tab bar item in a TabView. The example below adds two views as tabs in a TabView:
struct View1: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("View 1")
    }
}


struct View2: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("View 2")
    }
}


struct TabItem: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            View1()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Menu", systemImage: "list.dash")
                }


            View2()
                .tabItem {
                    Label("Order", systemImage: "square.and.pencil")
                }
        }
    }
}
