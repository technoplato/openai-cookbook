Type Method
requestAuthorization(_:)
Asks the user to allow your app to perform speech recognition.
iOS 10.0+
iPadOS 10.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
class func requestAuthorization(_ handler: @escaping (SFSpeechRecognizerAuthorizationStatus) -> Void)
Parameters
handler
The block to execute when your app's authorization status is known. The status parameter of the block contains your app's authorization status. The system does not guarantee the execution of this block on your app's main dispatch queue.
Discussion
Call this method before performing any other tasks associated with speech recognition. This method executes asynchronously, returning shortly after you call it. At some point later, the system calls the provided handler block with the results.
When your app's authorization status is SFSpeechRecognizerAuthorizationStatus.notDetermined, this method causes the system to prompt the user to grant or deny permission for your app to use speech recognition. The prompt includes the custom message you specify in the NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription key of your app's Info.plist file. The user's response is saved so that future calls to this method do not prompt the user again.
Important
Your app's Info.plist file must contain the NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription key with a valid usage description. If this key is not present, your app will crash when you call this method.
For more information about requesting authorization, see Asking Permission to Use Speech Recognition.
