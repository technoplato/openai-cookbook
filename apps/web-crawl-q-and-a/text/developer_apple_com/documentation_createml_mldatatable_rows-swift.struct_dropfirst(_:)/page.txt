func dropFirst(_ k: Int = 1) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
k
The number of elements to drop from the beginning of the collection. k must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence starting after the specified number of elements.
Discussion
If the number of elements to drop exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result is an empty subsequence.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.dropFirst(2))
// Prints "[3, 4, 5]"
print(numbers.dropFirst(10))
// Prints "[]"
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the number of elements to drop from the beginning of the collection.
