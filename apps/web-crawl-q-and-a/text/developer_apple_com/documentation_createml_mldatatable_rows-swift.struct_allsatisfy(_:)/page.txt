func allSatisfy(_ predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the passed element satisfies a condition.
Return Value
true if the sequence contains only elements that satisfy predicate; otherwise, false.
Discussion
The following code uses this method to test whether all the names in an array have at least five characters:
let names = ["Sofia", "Camilla", "Martina", "Mateo", "Nicolás"]
let allHaveAtLeastFive = names.allSatisfy({ $0.count >= 5 })
// allHaveAtLeastFive == true
If the sequence is empty, this method returns true.
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
