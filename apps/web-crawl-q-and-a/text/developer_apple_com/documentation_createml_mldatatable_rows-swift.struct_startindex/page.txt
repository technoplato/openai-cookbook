func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func formIndex(before: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
