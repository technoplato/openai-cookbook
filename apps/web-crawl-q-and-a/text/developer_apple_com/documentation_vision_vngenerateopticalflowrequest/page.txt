class VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest : VNTargetedImageRequest
Overview
This request operates at a pixel level, so both images need to have the same dimensions to successfully perform the analysis. Setting a region of interest limits the region in which the analysis occurs. However, the system reports the resulting observation at full resolution.
Optical flow requests are resource-intensive, so create only one request at a time, and release it immediately after generating optical flows.
Topics
Configuring the Request
var computationAccuracy: VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest.ComputationAccuracy
The accuracy level for computing optical flow.
enum VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequest.ComputationAccuracy
The supported optical flow accuracy levels.
var outputPixelFormat: OSType
The output buffer’s pixel format.
var keepNetworkOutput: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether to keep the raw pixel buffer coming from the machine learning network.
Accessing the Results
var results: [VNPixelBufferObservation]?
The results of the request to generate optical flow.
Identifying Request Revisions
let VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequestRevision2: Int
A constant for specifying revision 2 of the optical flow generation request.
let VNGenerateOpticalFlowRequestRevision1: Int
A constant for specifying revision 1 of the optical flow generation request.
