Preliminary_Trigger
A condition that, when met, performs an action.
Overview
Because it inherits Typed, this schema declares a Preliminary_Trigger as a type of prim. For more information about typed schemas, see USD Specification > Typed.
The runtime executes triggers based on:
User input, like a user’s tap gesture.
Scene state, including a prim’s proximity to the user’s device.
Programmatic conditions, like application state or a function result.
Declaration
class "Preliminary_Trigger" (
    inherits = </Typed>
)
Add a Tap Trigger to a Cube
The following example shows how a prim named TapCube opts in to notification of user taps.
#usda 1.0


def Cube "Cube" {}


def Preliminary_Trigger "TapCube" {
    uniform token info:id = "TapGesture"
    rel affectedObjects = [ </Cube> ]
}
