static func registerSystem()
Discussion
Calling this method informs RealityKit of a system of defined behavior for its scenes. RealityKit automatically creates an instance of all registered systems for every scene and calls every registered system’s update(context:) method every frame.
If you call registerSystem() multiple times, RealityKit ignores additional calls after the first.
