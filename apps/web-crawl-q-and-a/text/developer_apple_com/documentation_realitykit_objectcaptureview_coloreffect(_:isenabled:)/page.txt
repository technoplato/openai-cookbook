Instance Method
colorEffect(_:isEnabled:)
Returns a new view that applies shader to self as a filter effect on the color of each pixel.
RealityKit
SwiftUI

macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func colorEffect(
    _ shader: Shader,
    isEnabled: Bool = true
) -> some View
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply to self as a color filter.
isEnabled
Whether the effect is enabled or not.
Return Value
A new view that renders self with the shader applied as a color filter.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a color filter it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position, half4 color, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the pixel applied to the shader and color its source color, as a pre-multiplied color in the destination color space. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader. The function should return the modified color value.
Important
Views backed by AppKit or UIKit views may not render into the filtered layer. Instead, they log a warning and display a placeholder image to highlight the error.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
