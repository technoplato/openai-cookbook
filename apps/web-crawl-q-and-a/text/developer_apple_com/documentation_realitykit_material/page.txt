Overview
In RealityKit, a material defines the surface properties of a 3D model. It specifies how RealityKit renders the entity, including its color and whether it’s shiny or reflective. A ModelEntity may have one material that defines the way RealityKit renders the entire entity, or it may have several that define the look of different parts of the model.
RealityKit provides several different material structures for different types of rendering, including PhysicallyBasedMaterial, which is a versatile material capable of simulating real-world objects in a highly realistic manner, and UnlitMaterial, which RealityKit draws with no lighting effects or shadows.
If you import a model from a USDZ file, RealityKit automatically creates one or more PhysicallyBasedMaterial instances from the material properties contained in the file.
