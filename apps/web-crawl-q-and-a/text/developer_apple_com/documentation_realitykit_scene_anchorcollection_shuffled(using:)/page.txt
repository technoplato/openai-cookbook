Instance Method
shuffled(using:)
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.

func shuffled<T>(using generator: inout T) -> [Self.Element] where T : RandomNumberGenerator
Parameters
generator
The random number generator to use when shuffling the sequence.
Return Value
An array of this sequence’s elements in a shuffled order.
Overview
You use this method to randomize the elements of a sequence when you are using a custom random number generator. For example, you can shuffle the numbers between 0 and 9 by calling the shuffled(using:) method on that range:
let numbers = 0...9
let shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled(using: &myGenerator)
// shuffledNumbers == [8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 0, 5, 1]
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the sequence.
Note
The algorithm used to shuffle a sequence may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same shuffled order each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.

func reversed() -> [Self.Element]
Returns an array containing the elements of this sequence in reverse order.
func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]
Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
