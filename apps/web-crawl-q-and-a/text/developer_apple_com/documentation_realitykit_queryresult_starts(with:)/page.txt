Instance Method
starts(with:)
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.

func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with possiblePrefix: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool where PossiblePrefix : Sequence, Self.Element == PossiblePrefix.Element
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
possiblePrefix
A sequence to compare to this sequence.
Return Value
true if the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements of possiblePrefix; otherwise, false. If possiblePrefix has no elements, the return value is true.
Overview
This example tests whether one countable range begins with the elements of another countable range.
let a = 1...3
let b = 1...10


print(b.starts(with: a))
// Prints "true"
Passing a sequence with no elements or an empty collection as possiblePrefix always results in true.
print(b.starts(with: []))
// Prints "true"
Complexity: O(m), where m is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of possiblePrefix.

Comparing Sequences
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
