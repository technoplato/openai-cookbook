Model Integration Samples
Integrate tabluar, image, and text classifcation models into your app.
Overview
Use the provided Core ML sample code projects to learn how to classify numeric values, images, and text within applications. For example, you can detect poses of the human body, classify a group of images, and locate answers to questions in a text document.
Topics
Tabular Data Models
Integrating a Core ML Model into Your App
Add a simple model to an app, pass input data to the model, and process the model’s predictions.
Image Classification Models
Classifying Images with Vision and Core ML
Crop and scale photos using the Vision framework and classify them with a Core ML model.
Detecting human body poses in an image
Locate people and the stance of their bodies by analyzing an image with a PoseNet model.
Understanding a Dice Roll with Vision and Object Detection
Detect dice position and values shown in a camera frame, and determine the end of a roll by leveraging a dice detection model.
Text Classification Models
Finding answers to questions in a text document
Locate relevant passages in a document by asking the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model a question.
