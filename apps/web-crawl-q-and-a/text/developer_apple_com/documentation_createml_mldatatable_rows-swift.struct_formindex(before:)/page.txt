Manipulating Indices
var startIndex: Int
The position of the first row in a nonempty DataTable. If the DataTable is empty, startIndex is equal to endIndex.
var endIndex: Int
The DataTable’s “past the end” position—that is, the position one greater than the last valid subscript argument.
func formIndex(after: inout Self.Index)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func index(Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Self.Index?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func formIndex(inout Self.Index, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Self.Index) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
