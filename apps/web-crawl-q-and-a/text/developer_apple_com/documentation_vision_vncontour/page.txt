var normalizedPoints: [simd_float2]
The contour’s array of points in normalized coordinates.
func polygonApproximation(epsilon: Float) -> VNContour
Simplifies the contour to a polygon using a Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
Accessing Child Contours
var childContourCount: Int
The total number of detected child contours.
var childContours: [VNContour]
