Training a Style Transfer Model Asynchronously
static func train(trainingData: MLStyleTransfer.DataSource, parameters: MLStyleTransfer.ModelParameters, sessionParameters: MLTrainingSessionParameters) throws -> MLJob<MLStyleTransfer>
Begins an asynchronous style transfer model-training session.
static func makeTrainingSession(trainingData: MLStyleTransfer.DataSource, parameters: MLStyleTransfer.ModelParameters, sessionParameters: MLTrainingSessionParameters) throws -> MLTrainingSession<MLStyleTransfer>
Creates an asynchronous training session for a style transfer model.
static func resume(MLTrainingSession<MLStyleTransfer>) throws -> MLJob<MLStyleTransfer>
Begins or continues an asynchronous style transfer model-training session.
static func restoreTrainingSession(sessionParameters: MLTrainingSessionParameters) throws -> MLTrainingSession<MLStyleTransfer>
Creates an asynchronous training session for a style transfer model by restoring an existing training session’s state from its parameters.
Creating a Style Transfer Model from a Checkpoint
init(checkpoint: MLCheckpoint) throws
Creates a style transfer model from a training session checkpoint.
Training a Style Transfer Model Synchronously
init(trainingData: MLStyleTransfer.DataSource, parameters: MLStyleTransfer.ModelParameters) throws
Creates a style transfer model with a training dataset represented by a data source.
Stylizing an Image
func stylize(image: CGImage) throws -> CGImage?
Applies the style the model learned to an image.
Saving a Style Transfer Model
func write(to: URL, metadata: MLModelMetadata?) throws
Exports the style transfer model as a Core ML model file to a location in the file system.
func write(toFile: String, metadata: MLModelMetadata?) throws
Exports the style transfer model as a Core ML model file to the file path.
Describing a Style Transfer Model
var description: String
A text representation of the style transfer model.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the style transfer model that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the style transfer model shown in a playground.
Supporting Types
enum DataSource
A data source for a style transfer model.
struct ModelParameters
Parameters that affect the training process of a style transfer model.
Type Methods
static func downloadAssets() throws
Initiates a download of the mlmodel assets required for Style Transfer training. This will be performed automatically if needed at training time, but can be run independently prior to training.
