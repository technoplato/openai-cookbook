func map<Transformed>(_ transform: @escaping (Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Parameters
transform
A mapping closure. transform accepts an element of this sequence as its parameter and returns a transformed value of the same or of a different type. transform can also throw an error, which ends the transformed sequence.
Return Value
An asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements produced by the transform closure.
Overview
Use the map(_:) method to transform every element received from a base asynchronous sequence. Typically, you use this to transform from one type of element to another.
In this example, an asynchronous sequence called Counter produces Int values from 1 to 5. The closure provided to the map(_:) method takes each Int and looks up a corresponding String from a romanNumeralDict dictionary. This means the outer for await in loop iterates over String instances instead of the underlying Int values that Counter produces. Also, the dictionary doesn’t provide a key for 4, and the closure throws an error for any key it can’t look up, so receiving this value from Counter ends the modified sequence with an error.
let romanNumeralDict: [Int : String] =
    [1: "I", 2: "II", 3: "III", 5: "V"]


do {
    let stream = Counter(howHigh: 5)
        .map { (value) throws -> String in
            guard let roman = romanNumeralDict[value] else {
                throw MyError()
            }
            return roman
        }
    for try await numeral in stream {
        print("\(numeral) ", terminator: " ")
    }
} catch {
    print ("Error: \(error)")
}
// Prints: I  II  III  Error: MyError()

Filtering the Output
func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfies the given predicate.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence<Self>
Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence<Self>
Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence<Self>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?
Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncThrowingFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given error-throwing transformation with each element of this sequence.
func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that concatenates the results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>
Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.
func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>
Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
