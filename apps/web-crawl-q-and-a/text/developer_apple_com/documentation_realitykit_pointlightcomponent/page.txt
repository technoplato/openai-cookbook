Creating a Point Light Component
init(color: PointLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, attenuationRadius: Float)
Creates a point light component with the given configuration.
init(color: PointLightComponent.Color, intensity: Float, attenuationRadius: Float)
Creates a point light component with the given configuration.
Setting Color
var color: PointLightComponent.Color
A color for the point light.
var color: PointLightComponent.Color
A color for the point light.
typealias Color
A platform-specific type used to define color for a point light.
Configuring the Light
var attenuationRadius: Float
The point light attenuation radius in meters.
var intensity: Float
The intensity of the point light, measured in lumen.
Registering a Component Type
static func registerComponent()
Registers a new component type.
Comparing Point Light Components
static func == (PointLightComponent, PointLightComponent) -> Bool
Indicates whether two point light components are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two point light components are not equal.
Initializers
init(cgColor: CGColor, intensity: Float, attenuationRadius: Float)
Creates a new instance with the specified color, intensity and attenuation.
