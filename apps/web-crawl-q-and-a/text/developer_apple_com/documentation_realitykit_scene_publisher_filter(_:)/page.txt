func filter(_ isIncluded: @escaping (Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.Filter<Self>
Parameters
isIncluded
A closure that takes one element and returns a Boolean value indicating whether to republish the element.
Return Value
A publisher that republishes all elements that satisfy the closure.
Discussion
Combine’s filter(_:) operator performs an operation similar to that of doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Sequence/3018365-filter in the Swift Standard Library: it uses a closure to test each element to determine whether to republish the element to the downstream subscriber.
The following example, uses a filter operation that receives an Int and only republishes a value if it’s even.
let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
    .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: " ") }


// Prints: "2 4"
