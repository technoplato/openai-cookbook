Function
VNNormalizedPointForImagePoint(_:_:_:)
Projects a point from image coordinates into normalized coordinates.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
tvOS 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func VNNormalizedPointForImagePoint(
    _ imagePoint: CGPoint,
    _ imageWidth: Int,
    _ imageHeight: Int
) -> CGPoint
Parameters
imagePoint
The input point in image coordinate space.
imageWidth
The image width.
imageHeight
The image height.
Return Value
The input point projected into normalized coordinates.
Discussion
The resulting point in image coordinate space may have nonintegral (floating-point) coordinates.
