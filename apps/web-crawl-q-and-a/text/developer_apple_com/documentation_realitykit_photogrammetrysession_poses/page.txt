PhotogrammetrySession.Poses
Once initial photogrammetric calculations are complete, a data structure mapping the sample ID (or index if a folder was used) to the 6DOF algorithmically estimated pose of that sample is returned.

Instance Properties
let posesBySample: [Int : PhotogrammetrySession.Pose]
Mapping from the sample ID to the 6DOF algorithmically estimated pose of that sample. Each Pose will have a world translation and rotation representing that shot’s estimated pose (position and orientation in space) with respect to the estimated coordinate system.
var urlsBySample: [Int : URL]
Mapping from the sample ID to the image URL in the input folder corresponding to that sample ID. This simplifies the visualization of which image in the input folder corresponds to a given computed pose.
