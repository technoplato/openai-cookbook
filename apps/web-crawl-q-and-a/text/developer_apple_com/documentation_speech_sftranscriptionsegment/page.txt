class SFTranscriptionSegment : NSObject
Overview
Use SFTranscriptionSegment to get details about a part of an overall SFTranscription. An SFTranscriptionSegment represents an utterance, which is a vocalized word or group of words that represent a single meaning to the speech recognizer (SFSpeechRecognizer).
You don’t create transcription object segments directly. Instead, you access them from a transcription’s segments property.
A transcription segment includes the following information:
The text of the utterance, plus any alternative interpretations of the spoken word.
The character range of the segment within the formattedString of its parent SFTranscription.
A confidence value, indicating how likely it is that the specified string matches the audible speech.
A timestamp and duration value, indicating the position of the segment within the provided audio stream.
Topics

var substringRange: NSRange

var alternativeSubstrings: [String]

Assessing the Recognition Confidence Level
var confidence: Float
The level of confidence the speech recognizer has in its recognition of the speech transcribed for the segment.
Getting the Audio Timing Information
var timestamp: TimeInterval
The start time of the segment in the processed audio stream.
var duration: TimeInterval
