func padding(
    _ edges: Edge.Set = .all,
    _ length: CGFloat? = nil
) -> some View
Parameters
edges
The set of edges to pad for this view. The default is Edge/Set/all.
length
An amount, given in points, to pad this view on the specified edges. If you set the value to nil, SwiftUI uses a platform-specific default amount. The default value of this parameter is nil.
Return Value
A view that’s padded by the specified amount on the specified edges.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add a specified amount of padding to one or more edges of the view. Indicate the edges to pad by naming either a single value from Edge/Set, or by specifying an OptionSet that contains edge values:
VStack {
    Text("Text padded by 20 points on the bottom and trailing edges.")
        .padding([.bottom, .trailing], 20)
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The order in which you apply modifiers matters. The example above applies the padding before applying the border to ensure that the border encompasses the padded region:
You can omit either or both of the parameters. If you omit the length, SwiftUI uses a default amount of padding. If you omit the edges, SwiftUI applies the padding to all edges. Omit both to add a default padding all the way around a view. SwiftUI chooses a default amount of padding that’s appropriate for the platform and the presentation context.
VStack {
    Text("Text with default padding.")
        .padding()
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The example above looks like this in iOS under typical conditions:
To control the amount of padding independently for each edge, use View/padding(_:)-6pgqq. To pad all outside edges of a view by a specified amount, use View/padding(_:)-68shk.
