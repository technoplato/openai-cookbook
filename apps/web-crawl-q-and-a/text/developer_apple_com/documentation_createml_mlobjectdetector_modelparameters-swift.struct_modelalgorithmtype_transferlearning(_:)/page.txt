Case
MLObjectDetector.ModelParameters.ModelAlgorithmType.transferLearning(_:)
An algorithm that leverages the knowledge of a general purpose model built into the operating system.
macOS 11.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
case transferLearning(MLObjectDetector.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType)
Discussion
You typically use this transfer-learning algorithm to train an object detector in these situations:
Your training dataset has a limited number of examples. - You prefer your object detector’s Core ML model file to be as small as possible.

case darknetYolo
An algorithm that trains a full neural network with your training data.
enum FeatureExtractorType
The underlying base model that extracts image features for an object-detector training session.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
