MLClassifier.logisticRegression(_:)
A classifier that predicts a discrete target value as a function of data features.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
case logisticRegression(MLLogisticRegressionClassifier)
Discussion
Don’t create an MLClassifier using one of its enumeration cases. Use the classifier’s initializer instead.
