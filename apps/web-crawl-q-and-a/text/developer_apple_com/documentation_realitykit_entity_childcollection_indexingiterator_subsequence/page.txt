Splitting and Joining Entities
func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.
func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, around elements equal to the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func joined() -> FlattenSequence<Self>
Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.
func joined<Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence<Self>
Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.
func joined(separator: String) -> String
Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.
Available when Element conforms to StringProtocol.
