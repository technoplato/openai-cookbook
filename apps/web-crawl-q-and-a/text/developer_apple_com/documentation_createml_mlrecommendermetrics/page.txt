Structure
MLRecommenderMetrics
Metrics you use to evaluate a recommender’s performance.
macOS 10.15+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct MLRecommenderMetrics
Topics
Assessing the Model
let excludingObserved: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the recommender omitted training data from the recommendations.
var precisionRecall: MLDataTable
A data table with the recall and precision for each item.
Handling Errors
var isValid: Bool
A Boolean value indicating whether the recommender model was able to calculate metrics.
let error: (Error)?
The underlying error present when the metrics are invalid.
Creating Metrics
init(precisionRecall: MLDataTable, excludingObserved: Bool)
Creates metrics for a recommender, given a data table with precision and recall metric columns, and whether the recommender omitted training data.
Instance Properties
var precisionRecallDataFrame: DataFrame
A data table with the recall and precision for each item.
