Discussion
Ambient occlusion represents the entity’s exposure to ambient light.
Specify ambient occlusion using a UV-mapped image called an ambient occlusion map. A value of black (0.0) represents parts of the model that receive less ambient light because that part of the model is a crevice, dent, or recessed area, or because another part of the same entity is preventing ambient light from reaching it. Ambient occlusion values of white (1.0) represent flat portions of the model that receive full ambient light. You generate ambient occlusion maps using a 3D software package.
The following code loads an ambient occlusion map:
"entity_ao") {
    let aoMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(aoResource)
    material.emissiveColor = .init(texture: aoMap)
} ```
