Initializer
init(name:duration:axis:startTransform:spinClockwise:orientToPath:rotationCount:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:isAdditive:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)
Creates an animation that revolves an entity around its origin.

Parameters
name
A textual name for the animation.
duration
The elapsed time for one complete rotation.
axis
A 3D vector that points in the direction of the axis around which to rotate.
startTransform
The orbiting entity’s beginning position.
spinClockwise
A Boolean value that indicates whether the object orbits the center point in the clockwise direction.
orientToPath
A Boolean value that indicates whether the orbiting object updates its orientation during the animation to orient itself along the rotation path.
rotationCount
The number of times to rotate the target entity before stopping.
bindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
blendLayer
The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.
repeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
fillMode
The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.
isAdditive
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
trimStart
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
trimEnd
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.
trimDuration
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
offset
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
delay
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
speed
A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
