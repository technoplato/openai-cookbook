Initializer
init(rawValue:)
Creates a new option set from the given raw value.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(rawValue: Int)
Parameters
rawValue
The raw value of the option set to create. Each bit of rawValue potentially represents an element of the option set, though raw values may include bits that are not defined as distinct values of the OptionSet type.
Discussion
This initializer always succeeds, even if the value passed as rawValue exceeds the static properties declared as part of the option set. This example creates an instance of ShippingOptions with a raw value beyond the highest element, with a bit mask that effectively contains all the declared static members.
let extraOptions = ShippingOptions(rawValue: 255)
print(extraOptions.isStrictSuperset(of: .all))
// Prints "true"
