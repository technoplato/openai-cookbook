Case
ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.repeating(warmUp:emit:idle:)
Emits for the given emit duration, and waits idle seconds before looping, warmUp determines how long the simulation should appear to have run before first appearing.

case repeating(
    warmUp: TimeInterval? = nil,
    emit: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration,
    idle: ParticleEmitterComponent.Timing.VariableDuration? = nil
)
