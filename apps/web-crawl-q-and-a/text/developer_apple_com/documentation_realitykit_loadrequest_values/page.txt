var values: AsyncThrowingPublisher<Self> { get }
Discussion
This property provides an AsyncThrowingPublisher, which allows you to use the Swift async-await syntax to receive the publisher’s elements. Because AsyncPublisher conforms to AsyncSequence, you iterate over its elements with a for-await-in loop, rather than attaching a subscriber. If the publisher terminates with an error, the awaiting caller receives the error as a throw.
The following example shows how to use the values property to receive elements asynchronously. The example adapts a code snippet from the Publisher/tryFilter(_:) operator’s documentation, which filters a sequence to only emit even integers, and terminate with an error on a 0. This example replaces the Subscribers/Sink subscriber with a for-await-in loop that iterates over the AsyncPublisher provided by the values property. With this approach, the error handling previously provided in the sink subscriber’s Subscribers/Sink/receiveCompletion closure goes instead in a catch block.
let numbers: [Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5]
let filterPublisher = numbers.publisher
    .tryFilter{
        if $0 == 0 {
            throw ZeroError()
        } else {
            return $0 % 2 == 0
        }
    }


do {
    for try await number in filterPublisher.values {
        print ("\(number)", terminator: " ")
    }
} catch {
    print ("\(error)")
}
