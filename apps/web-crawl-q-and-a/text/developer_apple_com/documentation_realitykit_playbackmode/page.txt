playbackMode
Metadata that controls animation idling until a behavior takes over.
Overview
Set the playbackMode metadata on the document’s stage, that is, the outermost container for scene description. For more information about setting stage metadata, see UsdStage > Stage Metadata.
When an asset specifies playback metadata and a start animation, the animation plays automatically and loops until a trigger executes the StartAnimationAction. After the start animation completes, the asset’s behaviors (Preliminary_Behavior) take control of the animation. If you don’t define a start animation for the asset, this property indicates whether an animation should restart after it finishes playing.
Declaration
uniform token playbackMode = "loop" (
    allowedTokens = ["none","loop"]
)
Playback Modes
none
Runs a start animation only once until the system fires an animation trigger.
loop
Plays a start animation on a loop until the system fires an animation trigger.
Specify an Initial Idling Animation
The following metadata demonstrates playbackMode for an asset that defines a StartAnimationAction. This example sets playbackMode to loop, idling the animation in a perpetual replay until a trigger executes the start action.
#usda 1.0
(
    endTimeCode = 300
    startTimeCode = 1
    timeCodesPerSecond = 30
    playbackMode = "loop"
    upAxis = "Y"
)


def Xform "AnimatedModel"
{
    def Xform "body"
    {
        double3 xformOp:translate.timeSamples = { ... }
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]
        ...
    }
    ...
}
