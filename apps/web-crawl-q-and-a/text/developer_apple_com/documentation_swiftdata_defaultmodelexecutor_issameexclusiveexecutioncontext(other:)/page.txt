Instance Method
isSameExclusiveExecutionContext(other:)
If this executor has complex equality semantics, and the runtime needs to compare two executors, it will first attempt the usual pointer-based equality check, and if it fails it will compare the types of both executors, if they are the same, it will finally invoke this method, in an attempt to let the executor itself decide if this and the other executor represent the same serial, exclusive, isolation context.

func isSameExclusiveExecutionContext(other: Self) -> Bool
Parameters
other
the executor to compare with.
Return Value
true, if self and the other executor actually are mutually exclusive and it is safe–from a concurrency perspective–to execute code assuming one on the other.
Discussion
This method must be implemented with great care, as wrongly returning true would allow code from a different execution context (e.g. thread) to execute code which was intended to be isolated by another actor.
This check is not used when performing executor switching.
This check is used when performing preconditionTaskOnActorExecutor, preconditionTaskOnActorExecutor, assumeOnActorExecutor and similar APIs which assert about the same “exclusive serial execution context”.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
