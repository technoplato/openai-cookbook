Generic Instance Method
withUnsafeBufferPointer(ofType:_:)
Calls a given closure with a raw pointer to the multiarray’s storage.

func withUnsafeBufferPointer<S, R>(
    ofType type: S.Type,
    _ body: (_ ptr: UnsafeBufferPointer<S>) throws -> R
) rethrows -> R where S : MLShapedArrayScalar
Parameters
type
The element type of the buffer passed in the body. This must be a Swift primitive type equivalent to dataType. This closure takes the following parameter:
ptr
The pointer to the buffer.
body
A closure with an UnsafeBufferPointer parameter that points to the storage for the multiarray.
Discussion
The buffer contains a collection of int32, float16, float32, or float64 values, depending on the multiarray’s data type. It may not store these scalar values contiguously; use strides to get the buffer layout.
