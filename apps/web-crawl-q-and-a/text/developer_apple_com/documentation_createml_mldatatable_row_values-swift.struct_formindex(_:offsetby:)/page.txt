func formIndex(
    _ i: inout Self.Index,
    offsetBy distance: Int
)
Parameters
i
A valid index of the collection.
distance
The distance to offset i. distance must not be negative unless the collection conforms to the BidirectionalCollection protocol.
Discussion
The value passed as distance must not offset i beyond the bounds of the collection.
Complexity
O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the absolute value of distance.
