class MLModelConfiguration : NSObject
Overview
Use a model configuration to:
Set or override model parameters.
Designate which device the model uses to make predictions, such as a GPU.
Restrict the model to use a specific computational device category, such as a CPU.
You typically use a model configuration instance to configure an MLModel instance as you create it with init(contentsOf:configuration:) or create an MLUpdateTask. See Personalizing a Model with On-Device Updates.
Configure your model parameters by setting values for each relevant MLParameterKey in the parameters property.
Topics
Configuring Model Parameters
var modelDisplayName: String?
A human readable name of a model for display purposes.
var parameters: [MLParameterKey : Any]?
A dictionary of configuration settings your app can override when loading a model.
class MLParameterKey
The keys for the parameter dictionary in a model configuration or a model update context.
Configuring GPU Usage
var preferredMetalDevice: MTLDevice?
The metal device you prefer this model use to make predictions (inference) and update the model.
var allowLowPrecisionAccumulationOnGPU: Bool
A Boolean value that determines whether to allow low-precision accumulation on a GPU.
Allowing Access to Processing Units
var computeUnits: MLComputeUnits
The processing unit or units the model uses to make predictions.
enum MLComputeUnits
The set of processing-unit configurations the model can use to make predictions.
