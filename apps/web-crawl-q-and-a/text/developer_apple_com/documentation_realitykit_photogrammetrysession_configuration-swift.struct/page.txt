struct Configuration
Overview
A PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration instance may be passed in to any of the PhotogrammetrySession initializers to override its default values.
Use the default values in most instances. In some cases, you may improve the quality of the generated 3D object by specifying different values. If, for example, your source images have few landmarks or poor contrast, you might set featureSensitivity to PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.FeatureSensitivity.high to compensate for it.
Topics
Creating a Configuration
init()
Creates a configuration using default values.
Configuring Object Masking
var isObjectMaskingEnabled: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the session uses object masks.
Configuring Sample Ordering
var sampleOrdering: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.SampleOrdering
The order of the image samples.
enum SampleOrdering
The ordering of samples.
Configuring Feature Sensitivity
var featureSensitivity: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.FeatureSensitivity
The precision of landmark detection.
enum FeatureSensitivity
The sensitivity to sample landmarks.
Structures
struct CustomDetailSpecification
A structure for specifying various customizable options on the reconstructed model and textures.
Beta
Operators
static func == (PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration, PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init(checkpointDirectory: URL)
Beta
Instance Properties
var checkpointDirectory: URL?
For macOS reconstruction, the checkpoint directory is used as a temporary reconstruction space if it is not nil. Reconstruction always starts from scratch, there is no resuming.
Beta
var customDetailSpecification: PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification
To specify the .custom Detail level and control various specifications in the model output such as texture size, the specific PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration.CustomDetailSpecification should be set here. All .custom requests will then use these values. Other Detail level settings will ignore these.
