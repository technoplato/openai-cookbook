func highPriorityGesture<T>(
    _ gesture: T,
    including mask: GestureMask = .all
) -> some View where T : Gesture
Parameters
gesture
A gesture to attach to the view.
mask
A value that controls how adding this gesture to the view affects other gestures recognized by the view and its subviews. Defaults to SwiftUI/GestureMask/all.
Discussion
Use this method when you need to define a high priority gesture to take precedence over the view’s existing gestures. The example below defines a custom gesture that prints a message to the console and attaches it to the view’s VStack. Inside the VStack a red heart Image defines its own TapGesture handler that also prints a message to the console, and a blue rectangle with no custom gesture handlers. Tapping or clicking any of the views results in a console message from the high priority gesture attached to the enclosing VStack.
struct HighPriorityGestureExample: View {
    @State private var message = "Message"
    let newGesture = TapGesture().onEnded {
        print("Tap on VStack.")
    }


    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:25) {
            Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 75, height: 75)
                .padding()
                .foregroundColor(.red)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Tap on image.")
                }
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.blue)
        }
        .highPriorityGesture(newGesture)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .border(Color.purple)
    }
}
