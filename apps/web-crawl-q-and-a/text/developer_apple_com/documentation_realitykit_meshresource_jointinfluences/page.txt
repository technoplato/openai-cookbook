MeshResource.JointInfluences
A buffer of vertex-joint influences which bind the mesh part’s vertices to a skeleton via a skinning deformation.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct JointInfluences
Overview
Each vertex is associated with a fixed number of influences. If influencesPerVertex is 4, then there should be four elements in the buffer of joint influences for each vertex in the mesh part.
Note
If a particular vertex needs fewer influences than the influencesPerVertex value, the influences for that vertex can be padded with zero-weight influences.
Topics
Initializers
init(influences: MeshBuffers.JointInfluences, influencesPerVertex: Int)
Associates every vertex in the mesh with a fixed number of influences per vertex.
Instance Properties
var influences: MeshBuffers.JointInfluences
Buffer of joint influences.
