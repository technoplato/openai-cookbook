Initializer
init(avPlayer:)
Creates and initializes a video player component for a given AVPlayer object
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(avPlayer: AVPlayer)
Discussion
Note
Same AVPlayer object can not be used with more than one VideoPlayerComponent
To create a VideoPlayerComponent properly, first create an AVPlayer instance with no parameters then pass that to this initializer. After creating VideoPlayerComponent, create AVPlayerItem and add it to the AVPlayer object. The following code demonstrates this process.
// Create an AVPlayer instance to control playback of a movie.
let player = AVPlayer()


// Create an entity for display
let videoEntity = Entity()


// Create a VideoPlayerComponent object supplying the AVPlayer object
let videoPlayerComponent = VideoPlayerComponent(player: player)
videoEntity.components[VideoPlayerComponent.self] = videoPlayerComponent


// Create an URL that points to the movie file.
if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "MyMovie", withExtension: "mp4") {


    let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url)


    playerItem.addObserver(self, forKeyPath: #keyPath(AVPlayerItem.status),
                           options: [.old, .new], context: &self.playerStatusContext)


    player.replaceCurrentItem(with: playerItem)
}
avPlayer: An AVPlayer instance.
