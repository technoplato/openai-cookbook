func userActivity<P>(
    _ activityType: String,
    element: P?,
    _ update: @escaping (P, NSUserActivity) -> ()
) -> some View
Parameters
activityType
The type of activity to advertise.
element
If the element is nil, the handler will not be associated with the activity (and if there are no handlers, no activity is advertised). The method passes the non-nil element to the handler as a convenience so the handlers don’t all need to implement an early exit with guard element = element else { return }.
update
A function that modifies the passed-in activity for advertisement.
Discussion
The scope of the activity applies only to the scene or window the view is in.
