Instance Method
averagePrecision(predictions:annotations:confidenceThresholds:overlapThreshold:)
Calculates average precision for all the labels at the bounding box overlap threshold.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func averagePrecision<Scalar>(
    predictions: [[DetectedObject<Label>]],
    annotations: [ObjectDetectionAnnotation<Label>],
    confidenceThresholds: [Label : Float] = [:],
    overlapThreshold: Double = 0.5
) -> [Label : Scalar] where Scalar : BinaryFloatingPoint
Parameters
predictions
A list of all the predictions from an object detection model. Each element in the list is a list of predictions from one image.
annotations
A list of all the annotations. Each element is an ObjectDetectionAnnotation object from one image.
confidenceThresholds
Probability thresholds for each label. The values will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. If any label does not have a threshold, the defaultConfidenceThreshold is used for that label. The default value is [:].
overlapThreshold
The overlap threshold for the bounding boxes. The value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.5
Return Value
Average precision for all the labels at the overlap threshold.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
