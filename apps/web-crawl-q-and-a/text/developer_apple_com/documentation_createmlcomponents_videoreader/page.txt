Topics
Creating the Reader
init()
Creates a video reader.
Reading
static func read<S>(S) async throws -> [VideoReader.AsyncFrames]
Reads a sequence of files as an array of async sequences of video frames.
static func read<S, Annotation>(S) async throws -> [AnnotatedFeature<VideoReader.AsyncFrames, Annotation>]
Reads a sequence of annotated files as an array of annotated async sequences of video frames.
static func readCamera(configuration: VideoReader.CameraConfiguration) async throws -> VideoReader.CameraAsyncBuffers
Reads an async sequence of video frames captured with a video camera.
static func read(contentsOf: URL) async throws -> VideoReader.AsyncFrames
Reads a video file as an async sequence of video frames.
struct AsyncFrames
An async sequence of video frames.
struct CameraAsyncBuffers
