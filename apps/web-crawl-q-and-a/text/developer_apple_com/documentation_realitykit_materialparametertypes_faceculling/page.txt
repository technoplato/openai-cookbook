enum FaceCulling
Overview
To improve performance, RealityKit culls polygons, or faces, that it determines won’t be visible. Discarding faces that aren’t part of the final render elimininates the need to do any calculations for those faces. Use this object to specify what kind of polygons RealityKit culls.
Topics
Face Culling
case front
The system culls front-facing polygons.
case back
The system culls back-facing polygons.
case none
The system doesn’t cull polygons.
Comparisons
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value of the case.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the raw value by feeding it into the given hash function.
static func == (MaterialParameterTypes.FaceCulling, MaterialParameterTypes.FaceCulling) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether two instances aren’t equal.
