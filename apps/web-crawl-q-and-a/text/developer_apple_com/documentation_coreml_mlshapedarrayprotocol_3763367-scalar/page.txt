Inspecting a Shaped Array Type
var shape: [Int]
An integer array in which each element represents the size of the corresponding dimension.
Required
var strides: [Int]
An integer array in which each element is the number of memory locations that spans the length of the corresponding dimension.
Required
var count: Int
The number of elements in the shaped array’s first dimension.
var isScalar: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the shaped array lacks a shape.
var scalarCount: Int
The total number of elements in the shaped array type.
var scalars: [Self.Scalar]
A computed property that generates a linear array that contains every element, or assigns the elements of an array to the shaped array’s elements.
func withUnsafeShapedBufferPointer<R>((UnsafeBufferPointer<Self.Scalar>, [Int], [Int]) -> R) -> R
Provides read-only access of the shaped array’s underlying memory to a closure.
