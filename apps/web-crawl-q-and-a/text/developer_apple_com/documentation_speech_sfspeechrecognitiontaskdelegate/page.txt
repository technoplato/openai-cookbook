Protocol
SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate
A protocol with methods for managing multi-utterance speech recognition requests.
iOS 10.0+
iPadOS 10.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
protocol SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate
Overview
The methods of this protocol give you fine-grained control over the speech recognition process. Specifically, you use this protocol when you want to know the following:
When the first utterances of speech occur in the audio.
When the speech recognizer stops accepting audio.
When the speech recognition process finishes or is canceled.
When the speech recognizer generates a potential transcription.
Adopt the methods of this protocol in an object and pass that object in to the delegate parameter of recognitionTask(with:delegate:) when starting your speech recognition task.
Topics
Tracking the Task Progress
func speechRecognitionDidDetectSpeech(SFSpeechRecognitionTask)
Tells the delegate when the task first detects speech in the source audio.
func speechRecognitionTaskFinishedReadingAudio(SFSpeechRecognitionTask)
Tells the delegate when the task is no longer accepting new audio input, even if final processing is in progress.
Getting Transcriptions
func speechRecognitionTask(SFSpeechRecognitionTask, didHypothesizeTranscription: SFTranscription)
Tells the delegate that a hypothesized transcription is available.
Finishing a Speech Recognition Task
func speechRecognitionTask(SFSpeechRecognitionTask, didFinishRecognition: SFSpeechRecognitionResult)
Tells the delegate when the final utterance is recognized.
func speechRecognitionTask(SFSpeechRecognitionTask, didFinishSuccessfully: Bool)
Tells the delegate when the recognition of all requested utterances is finished.
func speechRecognitionTaskWasCancelled(SFSpeechRecognitionTask)
Tells the delegate that the task has been canceled.

Performing Speech Recognition on Audio
func recognitionTask(with: SFSpeechRecognitionRequest, resultHandler: (SFSpeechRecognitionResult?, Error?) -> Void) -> SFSpeechRecognitionTask
Executes the speech recognition request and delivers the results to the specified handler block.
func recognitionTask(with: SFSpeechRecognitionRequest, delegate: SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate) -> SFSpeechRecognitionTask
Recognizes speech from the audio source associated with the specified request, using the specified delegate to manage the results.
