Instance Method
delay(for:tolerance:scheduler:options:)
Delays delivery of all output to the downstream receiver by a specified amount of time on a particular scheduler.

func delay<S>(
    for interval: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride,
    tolerance: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride? = nil,
    scheduler: S,
    options: S.SchedulerOptions? = nil
) -> Publishers.Delay<Self, S> where S : Scheduler
Parameters
interval
The amount of time to delay.
tolerance
The allowed tolerance in delivering delayed events. The Delay publisher may deliver elements this much sooner or later than the interval specifies.
scheduler
The scheduler to deliver the delayed events.
options
Options relevant to the scheduler’s behavior.
Return Value
A publisher that delays delivery of elements and completion to the downstream receiver.
Discussion
Use delay(for:tolerance:scheduler:options:) when you need to delay the delivery of elements to a downstream by a specified amount of time.
In this example, a Timer publishes an event every second. The delay(for:tolerance:scheduler:options:) operator holds the delivery of the initial element for 3 seconds (±0.5 seconds), after which each element is delivered to the downstream on the main run loop after the specified delay:
let df = DateFormatter()
df.dateStyle = .none
df.timeStyle = .long
cancellable = Timer.publish(every: 1.0, on: .main, in: .default)
    .autoconnect()
    .handleEvents(receiveOutput: { date in
        print ("Sending Timestamp \'\(df.string(from: date))\' to delay()")
    })
    .delay(for: .seconds(3), scheduler: RunLoop.main, options: .none)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)", terminator: "\n") },
        receiveValue: { value in
            let now = Date()
            print ("At \(df.string(from: now)) received  Timestamp \'\(df.string(from: value))\' sent: \(String(format: "%.2f", now.timeIntervalSince(value))) secs ago", terminator: "\n")
        }
    )


// Prints:
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:33 PM PDT' to delay()
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:34 PM PDT' to delay()
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:35 PM PDT' to delay()
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:36 PM PDT' to delay()
//    At 5:02:36 PM PDT received  Timestamp '5:02:33 PM PDT' sent: 3.00 secs ago
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:37 PM PDT' to delay()
//    At 5:02:37 PM PDT received  Timestamp '5:02:34 PM PDT' sent: 3.00 secs ago
//    Sending Timestamp '5:02:38 PM PDT' to delay()
//    At 5:02:38 PM PDT received  Timestamp '5:02:35 PM PDT' sent: 3.00 secs ago
The delay affects the delivery of elements and completion, but not of the original subscription.

Controlling Timing
func measureInterval<S>(using: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.MeasureInterval<Self, S>
Measures and emits the time interval between events received from an upstream publisher.
func debounce<S>(for: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.Debounce<Self, S>
Publishes elements only after a specified time interval elapses between events.
func throttle<S>(for: S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, latest: Bool) -> Publishers.Throttle<Self, S>
Publishes either the most-recent or first element published by the upstream publisher in the specified time interval.
func timeout<S>(S.SchedulerTimeType.Stride, scheduler: S, options: S.SchedulerOptions?, customError: (() -> Self.Failure)?) -> Publishers.Timeout<Self, S>
Terminates publishing if the upstream publisher exceeds the specified time interval without producing an element.
