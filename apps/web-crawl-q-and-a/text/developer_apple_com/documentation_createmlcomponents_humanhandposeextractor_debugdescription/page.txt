var debugDescription: String { get }
Discussion
Calling this property directly is discouraged. Instead, convert an instance of any type to a string by using the String(reflecting:) initializer. This initializer works with any type, and uses the custom debugDescription property for types that conform to CustomDebugStringConvertible:
struct Point: CustomDebugStringConvertible {
    let x: Int, y: Int


    var debugDescription: String {
        return "(\(x), \(y))"
    }
}


let p = Point(x: 21, y: 30)
let s = String(reflecting: p)
print(s)
// Prints "(21, 30)"
The conversion of p to a string in the assignment to s uses the Point type’s debugDescription property.
