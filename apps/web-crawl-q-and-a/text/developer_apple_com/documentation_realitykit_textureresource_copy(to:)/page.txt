Instance Method
copy(to:)
Copies texture data to another texture.

@MainActor
func copy(to texture: MTLTexture) throws
Parameters
texture
Target texture for copying the data. It must have the same width and height as the TextureResource, and .shaderWrite usage.
Discussion
This method blocks until the data is copied. If a TextureResource.DrawableQueue has been attached to this resource, this function detaches it. This method copies all available mipmap sizes to texture.
Even though semantic is an optional, it is recommended that you provide a value. Specifying a semantic for this texture resource enables RealityKit to select an appropriate pixel format for the target texture.
Here is an example of using copy(to:) to get a texture resource’s raw pixel data:
let device: MTLDevice = ...
let resource: TextureResource = ...
let descriptor = MTLTextureDescriptor.texture2DDescriptor(
    pixelFormat: .rgba8Unorm,
    width: resource.width, // Must match
    height: resource.height, // Must match
    mipmapped: false)
descriptor.usage = .shaderWrite // Required for copy


guard let texture = device.makeTexture(descriptor: descriptor)
else { throw ... }
try resource.copy(to: texture)


#if os(OSX) // Managed mode exists only in OSX
if texture.storageMode == .managed {
    // Managed textures need to be synchronized before accessing their data
    guard let commandBuffer = device.makeCommandQueue()?.makeCommandBuffer(),
          let blitEncoder = commandBuffer.makeBlitCommandEncoder()
    else { throw ... }


    blitEncoder.synchronize(resource: texture)
    blitEncoder.endEncoding()
    commandBuffer.commit()
    commandBuffer.waitUntilCompleted()
}
#endif


// Getting raw pixel bytes
let bytesPerRow = 4 * texture.width
var bytes = [UInt8](repeating: 0, count: texture.height * bytesPerRow)
bytes.withUnsafeMutableBytes { bytesPtr in
    texture.getBytes(
        bytesPtr.baseAddress!,
        bytesPerRow: bytesPerRow,
        from: .init(origin: .init(), size: .init(width: texture.width, height: texture.height, depth: 1)),
        mipmapLevel: 0
    )
}
