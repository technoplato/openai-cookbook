Initializer
init(bounds:transform:)
Creates an instance with an optional bounding box and transform.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
init(
    bounds: BoundingBox = BoundingBox.empty,
    transform: Transform = Transform.identity
)
Parameters
bounds
An optional bounding box to specify the size of the generated 3D model. If you don’t pass a value, the initializer sets the bounding box to .empty, which tells RealityKit to calculate the object’s size.
transform
An optional Transform that RealityKit applies to the object after it’s created. Use this to scale, rotate, or move the object before the session publishes the PhotogrammetrySession.Output.requestComplete(_:_:)
