Instance Method
recommendations(fromUsers:maxCount:restrictingToItems:excluding:excludingObserved:)
Retrieves the highest scored items for the given column of users, based on item similarity and the rating column.
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func recommendations<T>(
    fromUsers: MLDataColumn<T>,
    maxCount: Int = 10,
    restrictingToItems: MLDataColumn<T>? = nil,
    excluding userItemObservations: MLDataTable? = nil,
    excludingObserved: Bool = true
) throws -> MLDataTable where T : MLDataValueConvertible, T : MLIdentifier
Parameters
fromUsers
A column of user identifiers.
maxCount
The maximum number of recommendations per user. The default is 10.
restrictingToItems
An array of item identifiers that defines the only values the recommender can use this set of recommendations. By default, the parameter is nil, meaning there are no restrictions.
userItemObservations
A data table of user-item observations to exclude from recommendations.
The default is nil, meaning no observations are excluded.
The column names for the user identifiers and item identifiers must be the same as those provided in the training data.
excludingObserved
Set this value to true to omit training data from the recommendations, or false to include them.
The default is true.
Return Value
An MLDataTable containing columns with user identifiers, item identifiers, scores and ranks (numbered between 1 and the maxCount).

protocol MLIdentifier
A type the Create ML framework can use as a machine learning identifier.
func getSimilarItems<T>(fromItems: MLDataColumn<T>, maxCount: Int) throws -> MLDataTable
Returns the top ranked similar items based on the model’s similarity type.
func getSimilarItems(fromItems: [MLIdentifier], maxCount: Int) throws -> MLDataTable
Returns the top ranked similar items based on the model’s similarity type.
