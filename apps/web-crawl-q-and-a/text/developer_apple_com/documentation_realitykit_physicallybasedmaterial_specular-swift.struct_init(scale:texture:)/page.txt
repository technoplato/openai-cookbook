Discussion
RealityKit automatically draws specular highlights for physically based materials using the values of various properties, primarily roughness and metallic. Specular highlights are bright spots of reflected light that appear on shiny objects.
While many real-world objects can be accurately and realistically simulated with just the core PBR properties, you can create additional realistic effects by augmenting the specular highlights.
This initializer creates a PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Specular object from a single value, an image texture, or both.
If you specify texture, RealityKit calculates the specular for the entity by UV-mapping texture onto the entity and multiplying the value of each mapped pixel by scale. If you don’t specify texture, RealityKit uses scale as the entire entity’s specular. If you provide a color image for texture rather than a grayscale image, RealityKit only uses the intensity of the image’s red channel.
scale: A value from 0.0 to 1.0 to use as the specular value for the material.
texture: An optional UV-mapped image texture.
