static let empty: BoundingBox
Discussion
An empty bounding box is defined with min set to positive infinity and max set to negative infinity.
Note
An empty bounding box where min is greater than max is different from a bounding box of size 0, where min is equal to max. The former defines empty space without a position. The latter describes an object of size 0 at a certain position in space.
