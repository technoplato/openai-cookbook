Topics
Structures
struct ImageSequence
Structure used to define properties of the sprite sheet, used by imageSequence.
Initializers
init()
Instance Properties
var acceleration: SIMD3<Float>
The constant acceleration vector, in meters per second squared, applied to all particles in the system.
var angle: Float
The rotation angle, in radians, of newly spawned particles. Defaults to 0.
var angleVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range (in radians) from which a value is randomly selected to offset angle.
var angularSpeed: Float
The initial spin rate, in radians per second, of newly spawned particles. Defaults to 0.
var angularSpeedVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range (in radians per second) from which a value is randomly selected to offset angularSpeed.
var areCollisionsEnabled: Bool
Determines if particles will collide with the provided collision planes.
var attractionCenter: SIMD3<Float>
The spot that the particles are attracted to. In local space. Defaults to (1, 1, 0).
var attractionStrength: Float
The particles are attracted to the attractionCenter by this amount. Defaults to 0.
var billboardMode: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.BillboardMode
The mode defining whether and how particles orient towards the camera. Defaults to billboardYAligned.
var birthRate: Float
The number of particles emitted over the emission duration. Defaults to 100.
var birthRateVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range from which a value is randomly selected to offset birthRate.
var blendMode: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.BlendMode
How overlapping particles are composited together. Defaults to alpha.
var bounce: Float
Controls how much particles bounce when they hit a collision surface. Defaults to 0.3.
var color: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.ParticleColor
The color of particles.
var colorEvolutionPower: Float
How quickly the color evolves from its start to its end color — a value of 1 is a linear transition, values below 1 transition quicker, values over 1 transition slower.
var dampingFactor: Float
A factor that slows particles relative to their velocity. Defaults to 0.
var friction: Float
Controls how much friction particles experience when they hit a collision surface. Defaults to 0.
var image: TextureResource?
The image that each particle will use. Defaults to a white circular texture.
var imageSequence: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.ImageSequence?
Determines if the particle image is a sprite sheet (used for animation).
var isLightingEnabled: Bool
Determines if particles are affected by scene lighting.
var lifeSpan: Double
The duration, in seconds, for which each particle is rendered before being removed from the scene. Defaults to 1.
var lifeSpanVariation: Double
Defines a plus/minus range (in seconds) from which a value is randomly selected to offset lifeSpan. Defaults to 0.2.
var mass: Float
The mass, in grams, of each particle in the system. Defaults to 1.
var massVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range (in grams) from which a value is randomly selected to offset mass.
var noiseAnimationSpeed: Float
Determines how fast the noise field changes over time. Defaults to 0.
var noiseScale: Float
Scale of the noise (turbulence) patterns. Defaults to 1.
var noiseStrength: Float
Strength of the noise (turbulence) fields affecting particle motion. Defaults to 0.
var opacityCurve: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.OpacityCurve
The curve of opacity change over the lifetime of the particle. Defaults to quickFadeInOut.
var size: Float
The rendered size, in units of the scene’s world coordinate space, of the particle image. Value is the half-extent of the particle’s quad. Defaults to 0.02.
var sizeMultiplierAtEndOfLifespan: Float
At the end of the particle lifespan, the particle’s size will be it’s initial size times this multiplier. Defaults to 0.1.
var sizeMultiplierAtEndOfLifespanPower: Float
How quickly or slowly particle size changes over its lifetime — a value of 1 is linear, values below 1 transition quicker, values above 1 transition slower.
var sizeVariation: Float
Defines a plus/minus range from which a value is randomly selected to offset size.
var sortOrder: ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.SortOrder
How overlapping particles are sorted before rendering. Defaults to increasingDepth.
var spreadingAngle: Float
The range, in radians, of randomized initial particle directions as radians describing the size of the spreading cone. Defaults to 0.
var stretchFactor: Float
How much a particle’s shape is stretched along its velocity direction (Billboard particles only).
var vortexDirection: SIMD3<Float>
Direction vector of the vortex axis. Defaults to (0, 1, 0).
var vortexStrength: Float
Strength of the vortex forces affecting particle motion. Defaults to 0.
