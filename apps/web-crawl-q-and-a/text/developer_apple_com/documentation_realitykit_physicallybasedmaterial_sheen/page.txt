Discussion
For a PhysicallyBasedMaterial, object, you can use sheen to add soft specular highlights that simulate subtle reflections like the ones that occur with some materials, primarily fabrics. You can specify sheen using a single color, or you can provide a UV-mapped image.
The following example specifies sheen using a single value for the entire material:
let sheenColor = PhysicallyBasedMaterial.Color(deviceRed: 0.8,
green: 0.8, blue: 0.8, alpha: 1.0)
material.sheen = .init(tint:sheenColor)
This example shows how to specify sheen using a UV-mapped image texture:
if let sheenResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_sheen") {
    let sheenMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(sheenResource)
    material.sheen = .init(texture: sheenMap)
}
