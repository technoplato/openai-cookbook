Discussion
In some cases Text may contain text of a particular language which doesn’t match the device UI language. In that case it’s useful to specify a language so line height, line breaking and spacing will respect the script used for that language. For example:
Text(verbatim: "แอปเปิล").typesettingLanguage(
    .explicit(.init(languageCode: .thai)))
Note: this language does not affect text localized localization.
