ModelDebugOptionsComponent.VisualizationMode.finalColor
A mode that displays the entity’s calculated color, ignoring transparency.

case finalColor
Discussion
Add a ModelDebugOptionsComponent with a visualization mode of finalColor to an entity to tell RealityKit to draw that entity’s calculated surface color with no transparency. This option causes RealityKit to render the object as if it were fully opaque. For entities that don’t use transparency, this option has no affect.
Here’s how to enable final color visualization for an entity:
if let robot = anchor.findEntity(named: "Robot") as?
ModelEntity {
    let component = ModelDebugOptionsComponent(visualizationMode: .finalColor)
    robot.modelDebugOptions = component
}
