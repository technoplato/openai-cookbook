func count() -> Publishers.Count<Self>
Return Value
A publisher that consumes all elements until the upstream publisher finishes, then emits a single value with the total number of elements received.
Discussion
Use count() to determine the number of elements received from the upstream publisher before it completes:
let numbers = (0...10)
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .count()
    .sink { print("\($0)") }


// Prints: "11"

func max() -> Publishers.Comparison<Self>
Publishes the maximum value received from the upstream publisher, after it finishes.
Available when Output conforms to Comparable.
func max(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.Comparison<Self>
Publishes the maximum value received from the upstream publisher, using the provided ordering closure.
func tryMax(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryComparison<Self>
Publishes the maximum value received from the upstream publisher, using the provided error-throwing closure to order the items.
func min() -> Publishers.Comparison<Self>
Publishes the minimum value received from the upstream publisher, after it finishes.
Available when Output conforms to Comparable.
func min(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) -> Bool) -> Publishers.Comparison<Self>
Publishes the minimum value received from the upstream publisher, after it finishes.
func tryMin(by: (Self.Output, Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryComparison<Self>
Publishes the minimum value received from the upstream publisher, using the provided error-throwing closure to order the items.
