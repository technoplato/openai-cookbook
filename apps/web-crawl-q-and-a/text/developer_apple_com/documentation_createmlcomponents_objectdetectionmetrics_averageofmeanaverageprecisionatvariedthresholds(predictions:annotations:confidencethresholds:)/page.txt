Instance Method
averageOfMeanAveragePrecisionAtVariedThresholds(predictions:annotations:confidenceThresholds:)
Calculates the average of mean average precision, computed at varied bounding box overlap thresholds. The overlap thresholds range is from [0.05, 0.95] with a stride of 0.05.

func averageOfMeanAveragePrecisionAtVariedThresholds<Scalar>(
    predictions: [[DetectedObject<Label>]],
    annotations: [ObjectDetectionAnnotation<Label>],
    confidenceThresholds: [Label : Float] = [:]
) -> Scalar where Scalar : BinaryFloatingPoint
Parameters
predictions
A list of all the predictions from an object detection model. Each element in the list is a list of predictions from one image.
annotations
A list of all the annotations. Each element is an ObjectDetectionAnnotation object from one image.
confidenceThresholds
Confidence thresholds for each label. The values will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. If any label does not have a threshold, the defaultConfidenceThreshold is used for that label. The default value is [:].
Return Value
The average of mean average precision, computed at varied bounding box overlap thresholds.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
