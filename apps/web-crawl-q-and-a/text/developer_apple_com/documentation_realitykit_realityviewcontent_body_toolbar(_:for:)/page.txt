func toolbar(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    for bars: ToolbarPlacement...
) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The preferred visibility of the bar.
bars
The bars to update the visibility of or ToolbarPlacement/automatic if empty.
Discussion
The preferred visibility flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS.
This examples shows a view that hides the navigation bar.
NavigationView {
    ContentView()
        .toolbar(.hidden)
}
You can provide multiple ToolbarPlacement instances to hide multiple bars at once.
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbar(
                .hidden, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
Note
In macOS, if you provide ToolbarCommands to the scene of your app, this modifier disables the toolbar visibility command while the value of the modifier is not ToolbarPlacement/automatic.
Depending on the specified bars, the requested visibility may not be able to be fullfilled.
