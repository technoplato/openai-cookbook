var preferBackgroundProcessing: Bool { get set }
Discussion
If set to true, this property reduces the request’s memory footprint, processing footprint, and CPU/GPU contention at the potential cost of longer execution time.
Setting this value can help ensure that Vision processing doesn’t block UI updates and other rendering on the main thread.
