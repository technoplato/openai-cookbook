struct ComposedTemporalTransformer<Inner, Outer> where Inner : TemporalTransformer, Outer : TemporalTransformer, Inner.Output == Outer.Input
Overview
The inner transformer’s output must match the outer transformer input. The result of this transformer is equivalent to invoking outer(inner(x)) on an input x,
Topics
Creating the Transformer
init(Inner, Outer)
Creates a transformer composition from two temporal transformers.
Getting the Properties
var inner: Inner
The inner transformer.
var outer: Outer
The outer transformer.
Applying
typealias Intermediate
The intermediate type.
typealias Input
The input type.
typealias Output
The output type.
typealias OutputSequence
The output sequence type.
Instance Methods
func applied<S>(to: S, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> ComposedTemporalTransformer<Inner, Outer>.OutputSequence
Performs the composed transformation on an input sequence.
