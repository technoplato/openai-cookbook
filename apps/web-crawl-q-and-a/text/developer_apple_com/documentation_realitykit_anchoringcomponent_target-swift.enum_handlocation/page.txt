Type Properties
static let aboveHand: AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation
The entity should be anchored above the center of the palm in the world space, regardless how the hand is rotated. Content anchored this way has its positive y axis pointing at the user’s head and its positive z axis pointing towards the ground.
static let indexFingerTip: AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation
The entity should be anchored to the tip of the index finger. Content anchored this way has its positive y axis in the direct on of the fingernail’s normal and its positive z axis pointing towards the side where the thumb is.
static let palm: AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation
The entity should be anchored to the center of the palm. Content anchored this way has its positive y axis pointing out of the palm and its negative z axis pointing towards the side where the thumb is.
static let thumbTip: AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation
The entity should be anchored to the tip of the thumb. Content anchored this way has its positive y axis in the direction of the fingernail’s normal and its negative z axis pointing towards the side where the index finger is.
static let wrist: AnchoringComponent.Target.HandLocation
The entity should be anchored to the center of the wrist on the back of the hand. Content anchored this way has its positive y axis pointing out of the back of the hand and its positive z axis pointing towards the side where the thumb is.
