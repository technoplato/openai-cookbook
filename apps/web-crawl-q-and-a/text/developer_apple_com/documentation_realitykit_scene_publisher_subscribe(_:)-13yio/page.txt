func subscribe<S>(_ subscriber: S) where S : Subscriber, Self.Failure == S.Failure, Self.Output == S.Input
Parameters
subscriber
The subscriber to attach to this publisher. After attaching, the subscriber can start to receive values.
Discussion
Always call this function instead of receive(subscriber:). Adopters of Scene.Publisher must implement receive(subscriber:). The implementation of Publisher/subscribe(_:)-4u8kn provided by Scene.Publisher calls through to receive(subscriber:).
