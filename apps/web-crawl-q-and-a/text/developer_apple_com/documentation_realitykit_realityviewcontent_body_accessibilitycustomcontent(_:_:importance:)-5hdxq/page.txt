func accessibilityCustomContent(
    _ label: Text,
    _ value: Text,
    importance: AXCustomContent.Importance = .default
) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Parameters
label
Localized text describing to the user what is contained in this additional information entry. For example: “orientation”.
value
Text value for the additional accessibility information. For example: “landscape.”
importance
Importance of the accessibility information. High-importance information gets read out immediately, while default-importance information must be explicitly asked for by the user.
Discussion
Use this method to add information you want accessibility users to be able to access about this element, beyond the basics of label, value, and hint. For example: accessibilityCustomContent can be used to add information about the orientation of a photograph, or the number of people found in the picture.
Note
Repeated calls of accessibilityCustomContent with different labels will create new entries of additional information. Calling accessibilityAdditionalContent repeatedly with the same label will instead replace the previous value and importance.
Beta Software
