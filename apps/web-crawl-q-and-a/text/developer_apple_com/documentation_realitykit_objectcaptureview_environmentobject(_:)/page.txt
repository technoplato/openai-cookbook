func environmentObject<T>(_ object: T) -> some View where T : ObservableObject
Parameters
object
The object to store and make available to the view’s hierarchy.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add an observable object to a view’s environment. The object must conform to the ObservableObject protocol.
Adding an object to a view’s environment makes the object available to subviews in the view’s hierarchy. To retrieve the object in a subview, use the EnvironmentObject property wrapper.
Note
If the observable object conforms to the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocol, use either View/environment(_:)-4516h or the View/environment(_:_:) modifier to add the object to the view’s environment.
