Discussion
For texture properties that use the raw semantic, the number of channels and values is the same as the source image. If the source image contains color space information, RealityKit ignores it. For raw textures, each individual pixel containes one floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 for each channel in the source image. For example, a grayscale source image results in a texture that contains one value per pixel, and an RGB source image results in three values per pixel.
