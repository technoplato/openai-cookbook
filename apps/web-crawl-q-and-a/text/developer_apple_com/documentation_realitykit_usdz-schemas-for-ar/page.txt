USDZ Schemas for AR
Add augmented reality functionality to your 3D content using new USD schemas.
Overview
Leveraging Pixar’s Universal Scene Description standard, USDZ delivers AR and 3D content to Apple devices. Apple developed a set of new schemas in collaboration with Pixar to further extend the format for AR use cases. Simply add data to a USDZ file to give your 3D assets AR abilities, such as the ability to:
Anchor 3D content at a specific location in the real world.
React to real-world situations.
Participate in a physics simulation.
Connect audio effects to a location.
Annotate the environment by displaying text.
A USDZ file uses these schemas to add features to an augmented reality experience in AR Quick Look or RealityKit in place of .reality files, .rcproject files, or custom code to implement AR functionality. Reality Composer describes AR features in its USDZ export using these schemas, too (see Exporting a Reality Composer Scene to USDZ). To enable AR features in assets from a third-party digital content-creation (DCC) tool such as Maya or Houdini, edit the file in .usda textual format using the USD Toolset.
Note
These new schemas (see Schema definitions for third-party DCCs) are included in the Universal Scene Description specification as an addendum and are marked as preliminary. The addendum also adds metadata (name-value pairs; see Metadata), and new data properties (Property). To provide feedback on the addendum, use the Feedback Assistant.
Implement AR Functionality
The following illustration depicts a virtual castle rendered by a runtime, the app or system framework that implements the AR functionality described in the schemas. The prim for the virtual castle (USD refers to individual units of 3D content as _prims; _see UsdPrim) instructs the runtime to place the castle on a known image in the physical environment, called the image anchor. When the user comes into proximity with the anchor, the runtime displays the 3D visualization of the castle. Falling snowflakes represent additional prims that behave as if in accordance with gravity, and disappear as they approach a real-world surface.
Topics
Animation
Control animation playback with metadata.
autoPlay
Metadata that specifies whether an animation plays automatically on load.
playbackMode
Metadata that controls animation idling until a behavior takes over.
Anchoring
Place a prim at the physical location of a real-world object.
Placing a Prim in the Real World
Anchor a prim to a real-world object that the runtime recognizes in the physical environment.
