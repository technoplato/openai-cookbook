Instance Method
partition(by:)
Reorders the elements of the collection such that all the elements that match the given predicate are after all the elements that don’t match.

mutating func partition(by belongsInSecondPartition: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Int
Parameters
belongsInSecondPartition
A predicate used to partition the collection. All elements satisfying this predicate are ordered after all elements not satisfying it.
Return Value
The index of the first element in the reordered collection that matches belongsInSecondPartition. If no elements in the collection match belongsInSecondPartition, the returned index is equal to the collection’s endIndex.
Discussion
After partitioning a collection, there is a pivot index p where no element before p satisfies the belongsInSecondPartition predicate and every element at or after p satisfies belongsInSecondPartition. This operation isn’t guaranteed to be stable, so the relative ordering of elements within the partitions might change.
In the following example, an array of numbers is partitioned by a predicate that matches elements greater than 30.
var numbers = [30, 40, 20, 30, 30, 60, 10]
let p = numbers.partition(by: { $0 > 30 })
// p == 5
// numbers == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40]
The numbers array is now arranged in two partitions. The first partition, numbers[..<p], is made up of the elements that are not greater than 30. The second partition, numbers[p...], is made up of the elements that are greater than 30.
let first = numbers[..<p]
// first == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30]
let second = numbers[p...]
// second == [60, 40]
Note that the order of elements in both partitions changed. That is, 40 appears before 60 in the original collection, but, after calling partition(by:), 60 appears before 40.
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
