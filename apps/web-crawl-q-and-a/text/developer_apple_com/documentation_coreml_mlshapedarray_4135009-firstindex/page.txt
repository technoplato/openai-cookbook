Instance Method
firstIndex(of:)
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+

func firstIndex(of element: MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Int?
Parameters
element
An element to search for in the collection.
Return Value
The first index where element is found. If element is not found in the collection, returns nil.
Discussion
After using firstIndex(of:) to find the position of a particular element in a collection, you can use it to access the element by subscripting. This example shows how you can modify one of the names in an array of students.
var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime"]
if let i = students.firstIndex(of: "Maxime") {
    students[i] = "Max"
}
print(students)
// Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Max"]"
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

var endIndex: Int
The index of the last element in the shaped array.
var indices: Range<Int>
The index range of all the elements in the shaped array.
func index(after: Int) -> Int
Returns the index immediately after an index you provide.
func index(Int, offsetBy: Int) -> Int
Returns the index at a relative distance to an index you provide.
func index(Int, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Int) -> Int?
Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index, unless that distance is beyond a given limiting index.
func index(of: MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Int?
Returns the first index where the specified value appears in the collection.
Deprecated

Beta
func formIndex(before: inout Int)
Replaces the given index with its predecessor.
func formIndex(after: inout Int)
Replaces the given index with its successor.
func formIndex(inout Int, offsetBy: Int)
Offsets the given index by the specified distance.
func formIndex(inout Int, offsetBy: Int, limitedBy: Int) -> Bool
Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.
func firstIndex(where: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int?
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate.
func lastIndex(where: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Int?
Returns the index of the last element in the collection that matches the given predicate.
func lastIndex(of: MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Int?
Returns the last index where the specified value appears in the collection.
func ranges<C>(of: C) -> [Range<Int>]
Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence within the collection.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.
func firstRange<C>(of: C) -> Range<Int>?
Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given collection within this collection.
