Instance Method
popover(item:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)
Presents a popover using the given item as a data source for the popover’s content.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func popover<Item, Content>(
    item: Binding<Item?>,
    attachmentAnchor: PopoverAttachmentAnchor = .rect(.bounds),
    arrowEdge: Edge = .top,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Item) -> Content
) -> some View where Item : Identifiable, Content : View
Parameters
item
A binding to an optional source of truth for the popover. When item is non-nil, the system passes the contents to the modifier’s closure. You use this content to populate the fields of a popover that you create that the system displays to the user. If item changes, the system dismisses the currently presented popover and replaces it with a new popover using the same process.
attachmentAnchor
The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover. The default is Anchor/Source/bounds.
arrowEdge
The edge of the attachmentAnchor that defines the location of the popover’s arrow in macOS. The default is Edge/top. iOS ignores this parameter.
content
A closure returning the content of the popover.
Discussion
Use this method when you need to present a popover with content from a custom data source. The example below uses data in the PopoverModel structure to populate the view in the content closure that the popover displays to the user:
struct PopoverExample: View {
    @State private var popover: PopoverModel?


    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Popover") {
            popover = PopoverModel(message: "Custom Message")
        }
        .popover(item: $popover) { detail in
            Text("\(detail.message)")
                .padding()
        }
    }
}


struct PopoverModel: Identifiable {
    var id: String { message }
    let message: String
}
