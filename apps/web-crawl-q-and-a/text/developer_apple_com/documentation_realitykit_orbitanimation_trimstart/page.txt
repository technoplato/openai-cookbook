Instance Property
trimStart
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.

var trimStart: TimeInterval? { get set }
Discussion
This property is nil by default, which plays the animation with time = 0. If you set a value, the animation edits the duration according to the specified beginning time.
If you set a negative value for this property, the duration increases and the additional animation data fills in based on the fillMode you choose.
