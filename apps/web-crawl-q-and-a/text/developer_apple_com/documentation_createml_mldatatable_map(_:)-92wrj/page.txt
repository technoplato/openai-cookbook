func map<T>(_ lazyTransform: @escaping (MLDataTable.Row) -> T) -> MLDataColumn<T> where T : MLDataValueConvertible
Discussion
Use this method to create a new column derived from the existing data in the table. The closure you pass evaluates lazily only when the transformed values are needed for a subsequent operation. Your implementation should accept a data table row and must be thread-safe because the framework may invoke the closure concurrently on unspecified threads.
For example, to perform the column derivation operation shown above, begin by creating a table of data.
    "Day": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
    "Temperature": [91.3, 85.8, 79.5, 83.4, 72.2]
]


var table = try MLDataTable(dictionary: data) ```


After creating the table, use ``MLDataTable/map(_:)-92wrj`` to create a
new column of data from the original data. The example closure
implementation below is stateless and safe to invoke concurrently on any
thread, so no synchronization is necessary.


```swift let derivedColumn = table.map { row -> String in
    guard let day = row["Day"]?.stringValue,
          let temperature = row["Temperature"]?.doubleValue else {
            fatalError("Missing or invalid columns in row.")
    }
    return String(format: "%@ %.1fº", day, temperature)
} ```


Then use ``MLDataTable/addColumn(_:named:)-kkbw`` to add the derived
column to a table.


```swift table.addColumn(derivedColumn, named: "Description") ```


- Parameters:
  - lazyTransform: A thread-safe row transformation function.


    The implementation of your transform must accept a row from the data table and return
a type that conforms to ``MLDataValueConvertible``.


- Returns: A new ``MLDataColumn``.
