Enumeration
MLComputeUnits
The set of processing-unit configurations the model can use to make predictions.

enum MLComputeUnits : Int, @unchecked Sendable
Overview
Use this enumeration to set or inspect the processing units you allow a model to use when it makes a prediction.
Use all to allow the OS to select the best processing unit to use (including the neural engine, if available).
Use MLComputeUnits.cpuOnly to restrict the model to the CPU, if your app might run in the background or runs other GPU intensive tasks.
Topics
Processing Unit Configurations
case all
The option you choose to allow the model to use all compute units available, including the neural engine.
case cpuOnly
The option you choose to limit the model to only use the CPU.
case cpuAndGPU
The option you choose to allow the model to use both the CPU and GPU, but not the neural engine.
case cpuAndNeuralEngine
The option you choose to allow the model to use both the CPU and neural engine, but not the GPU.
