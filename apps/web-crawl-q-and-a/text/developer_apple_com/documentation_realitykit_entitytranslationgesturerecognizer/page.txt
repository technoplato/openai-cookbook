class EntityTranslationGestureRecognizer
Overview
A gesture recognizer that handles pan and dragging gestures on an entity.
Topics
Creating a Recognizer
init(target: Any?, action: Selector?)
Using the Recognizer
var entity: (HasCollision)?
The entity the receiver is associated with
func canPrevent(UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
func location(in: Entity?) -> SIMD3<Float>?
Returns the unprojected location of the gesture represented by the receiver in the space of the given entity.
func reset()
Overridden to reset internal state when a gesture recognition attempt completes.
func setTranslation(SIMD3<Float>, in: Entity?)
Sets the translation of the receiver in the entity’s coordinate space
func touchesBegan(Set<UITouch>, with: UIEvent)
Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers touch down on the associated entity.
func touchesCancelled(Set<UITouch>, with: UIEvent)
Sent to the gesture recognizer when a system event (such as an incoming phone call) cancels a touch event.
func touchesEnded(Set<UITouch>, with: UIEvent)
Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers lift from the associated view.
func touchesMoved(Set<UITouch>, with: UIEvent)
Sent to the gesture recognizer when one or more fingers move in the associated view.
func translation(in: Entity?) -> SIMD3<Float>?
The translation of the gesture in the space of the specified entity.
func velocity(in: Entity?) -> SIMD3<Float>
The velocity of the translation gesture in the space of the specified entity.

func installGestures(ARView.EntityGestures, for: HasCollision) -> [EntityGestureRecognizer]
Installs standard gestures onto the given entity, configured to be recognized simultaneously.
struct EntityGestures
The set of possible entity gesture recognizers.
func gestureRecognizer(UIGestureRecognizer, shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
Determines whether two gesture recognizers should simultaneously recognize a gesture.
class EntityRotationGestureRecognizer
A gesture recognizer that uses rotation gestures involving two touches to rotate a given entity.
class EntityScaleGestureRecognizer
A gesture recognizer that uses a pinch gesture to scale or zoom an entity.
protocol EntityGestureRecognizer
A gesture recognizer that works on entities.
