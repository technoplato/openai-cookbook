Generic Instance Method
difference(from:)
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+

Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 13.0+

Xcode 11.0+
func difference<C>(from other: C) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>> where C : BidirectionalCollection, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar> == C.Element
Parameters
other
The base state.
Return Value
The difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection.
Discussion
This function does not infer element moves. If you need to infer moves, call the inferringMoves() method on the resulting difference.
Complexity: Worst case performance is O(n * m), where n is the count of this collection and m is other.count. You can expect faster execution when the collections share many common elements, or if Element conforms to Hashable.

Comparing Shaped Array Slices
func compare<Comparator>(Comparator.Compared, Comparator.Compared) -> ComparisonResult
Returns a comparison result by comparing two shaped array slices.
func difference<C>(from: C, by: (C.Element, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> CollectionDifference<MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>>
Returns the difference needed to produce this collection’s ordered elements from the given collection, using the given predicate as an equivalence test.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, OtherSequence.Element) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, PossiblePrefix.Element) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>, MLShapedArraySlice<Scalar>) -> Bool) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
