subscript(i: Int) -> String { get }
Parameters
position
The position of the element to access. position must be a valid index of the collection that is not equal to the endIndex property.
Overview
The following example accesses an element of an array through its subscript to print its value:
var streets = ["Adams", "Bryant", "Channing", "Douglas", "Evarts"]
print(streets[1])
// Prints "Bryant"
You can subscript a collection with any valid index other than the collection’s end index. The end index refers to the position one past the last element of a collection, so it doesn’t correspond with an element.
