Initializer
init(labeledByNamesAt:separator:index:type:continueOnFailure:)
Reads training examples from a directory containing files having their labels in the name. The name can contain multiple words separated by a separator. So the index tells the position of the label in the file name. Files with incorrect name format are ignored.

init(
    labeledByNamesAt url: URL,
    separator: Character = ".",
    index: Int = 0,
    type: UTType,
    continueOnFailure: Bool = false
) throws
Parameters
url
URL of directory containing the files.
separator
The separator used in the name. Default value is “.”
index
Index of the label in the file name. Default value is 0.
type
Type of files.
continueOnFailure
A Boolean value indicating whether to continue reading files after encountering a file that is not readable. The default value is false.
Discussion
Take for example this directory structure:
/
    fold1-foo-file1.png
    fold1-foo-file2.png
    fold2-foo-file3.png
    fold1-bar-file4.png
    fold1-bar-file5.png
    fold2-bar-file6.png
When we specify separator as “-” and index as 1, it would produce two labels (foo and bar) with three URLs each.
