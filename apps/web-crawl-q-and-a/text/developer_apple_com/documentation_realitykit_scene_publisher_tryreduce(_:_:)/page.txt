Instance Method
tryReduce(_:_:)
Applies an error-throwing closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.

func tryReduce<T>(
    _ initialResult: T,
    _ nextPartialResult: @escaping (T, Self.Output) throws -> T
) -> Publishers.TryReduce<Self, T>
Parameters
initialResult
The value that the closure receives the first time it’s called.
nextPartialResult
An error-throwing closure that takes the previously-accumulated value and the next element from the upstream publisher to produce a new value.
Return Value
A publisher that applies the closure to all received elements and produces an accumulated value when the upstream publisher finishes.
Discussion
Use tryReduce(_:_:) to collect a stream of elements and produce an accumulated value based on an error-throwing closure you provide. If the closure throws an error, the publisher fails and passes the error to its subscriber.
In the example below, the publisher’s 0 element causes the myDivide(_:_:) function to throw an error and publish the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Double/1641611-nan result:
struct DivisionByZeroError: Error {}
func myDivide(_ dividend: Double, _ divisor: Double) throws -> Double {
    guard divisor != 0 else { throw DivisionByZeroError() }
    return dividend / divisor
}


var numbers: [Double] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
numbers.publisher
    .tryReduce(numbers.first!, { accum, next in try myDivide(accum, next) })
    .catch({ _ in Just(Double.nan) })
    .sink { print("\($0)") }

Reducing Elements
func collect() -> Publishers.Collect<Self>
Collects all received elements, and emits a single array of the collection when the upstream publisher finishes.
func collect(Int) -> Publishers.CollectByCount<Self>
Collects up to the specified number of elements, and then emits a single array of the collection.
func collect<S>(Publishers.TimeGroupingStrategy<S>, options: S.SchedulerOptions?) -> Publishers.CollectByTime<Self, S>
Collects elements by a given time-grouping strategy, and emits a single array of the collection.
func ignoreOutput() -> Publishers.IgnoreOutput<Self>
Ignores all upstream elements, but passes along the upstream publisher’s completion state (finished or failed).
func reduce<T>(T, (T, Self.Output) -> T) -> Publishers.Reduce<Self, T>
Applies a closure that collects each element of a stream and publishes a final result upon completion.
