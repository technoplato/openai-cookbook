func drop(while predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
predicate
A closure that takes an element of the sequence as its argument and returns true if the element should be skipped or false if it should be included. Once the predicate returns false it will not be called again.
Overview
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
