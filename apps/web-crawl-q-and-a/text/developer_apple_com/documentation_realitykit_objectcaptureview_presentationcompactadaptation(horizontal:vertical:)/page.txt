func presentationCompactAdaptation(
    horizontal horizontalAdaptation: PresentationAdaptation,
    vertical verticalAdaptation: PresentationAdaptation
) -> some View
Parameters
horizontalAdaptation
The adaptation to use in a horizontally compact size class.
verticalAdaptation
The adaptation to use in a vertically compact size class. In a size class that is both horizontally and vertically compact, SwiftUI uses the verticalAdaptation value.
Discussion
Some presentations adapt their appearance depending on the context. For example, a popover presentation over a horizontally-compact view uses a sheet appearance by default. Use this modifier to indicate a custom adaptation preference.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showInfo = false


    var body: some View {
        Button("View Info") {
            showInfo = true
        }
        .popover(isPresented: $showInfo) {
            InfoView()
                .presentationCompactAdaptation(
                    horizontal: .popover,
                    vertical: .sheet)
        }
    }
}
If you want to specify the same adaptation for both dimensions, use the View/presentationCompactAdaptation(_:) method instead.
