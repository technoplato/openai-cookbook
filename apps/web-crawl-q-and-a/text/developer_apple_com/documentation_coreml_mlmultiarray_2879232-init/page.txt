Initializer
init(shape:dataType:)
Creates a multidimensional array with a shape and type.
iOS 11.0+
iPadOS 11.0+
macOS 10.13+
Mac Catalyst 13.1+
tvOS 11.0+
watchOS 4.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    shape: [NSNumber],
    dataType: MLMultiArrayDataType
) throws
Parameters
shape
An integer array that has an element for each dimension in a multiarray that represents its length.
dataType
An element type defined by MLMultiArrayDataType.
Discussion
This method allocates a contiguous region of memory for the multiarray’s shape. You must set the contents of memory. The multiarray frees the memory in its deinitializer.
The following code creates a 3 x 3 multiarray and sets its contents to the value 3.14159.
// Create a 2D multiarray with dimension 3 x 3.
let shape3x3 = [3, 3] as [NSNumber]


guard let multiarray3x3 = try? MLMultiArray(shape: shape3x3, dataType: .float) else {
    // Handle the error.
    return
}


print("Before: \(multiarray3x3)")


// Initialize the multiarray.
for xCoordinate in 0..<3 {
    for yCoordinate in 0..<3 {
        let key = [xCoordinate, yCoordinate] as [NSNumber]
        multiarray3x3[key] = 3.141_59
    }
}


print("After: \(multiarray3x3)")
