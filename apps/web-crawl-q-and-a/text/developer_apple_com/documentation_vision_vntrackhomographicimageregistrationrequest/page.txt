Class
VNTrackHomographicImageRegistrationRequest
An image analysis request, as a stateful request you track over time, that determines the perspective warp matrix necessary to align the content of two images.

class VNTrackHomographicImageRegistrationRequest : VNStatefulRequest
Overview
This request is similar to VNHomographicImageRegistrationRequest. However, as a VNStatefulRequest, it automatically computes the registration against the previous frame.
Topics
Creating a Homographic Image
init()
Creates a new request that tracks the homographic transformation of two images.
init(completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)
Creates a new request that tracks the homographic transformation of two images, with a system callback on completion.
Accessing the Results
var results: [VNImageHomographicAlignmentObservation]?
The observed homographic image alignment request.
