Instance Method
playAnimation(named:transitionDuration:startsPaused:recursive:)
Plays all the animations with the given name on the entity.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@discardableResult @MainActor
func playAnimation(
    named animationName: String,
    transitionDuration: TimeInterval = 0,
    startsPaused: Bool = false,
    recursive: Bool = true
) -> AnimationPlaybackController
Deprecated
Use playAnimation functions that utilize an AnimationResource instead of a name.
Parameters
animationName
The name of the animation.
Return Value
An animation playback controller that you can use to start and stop the animations.
Discussion
The method plays all the animations in the availableAnimations property with a matching name. If there are none, the method returns a controller showing a stopped animation.
transitionDuration: The duration in seconds over which the animation fades in or cross-fades.
startsPaused: A Boolean that you set to true to return from the call with the animations paused. Set to false to start the animations right away.
recursive: Indicates whether to also play animations on all descendants of the entity.
