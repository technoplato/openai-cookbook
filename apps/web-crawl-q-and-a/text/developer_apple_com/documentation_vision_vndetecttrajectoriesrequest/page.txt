Class
VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest
A request that detects the trajectories of shapes moving along a parabolic path.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
tvOS 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
class VNDetectTrajectoriesRequest : VNStatefulRequest
Overview
After the request detects a trajectory, it produces an observation that contains the shape’s detected points and an equation describing the parabola.
Topics
Creating a Request
init(frameAnalysisSpacing: CMTime, trajectoryLength: Int, completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler?)
Creates a new request to detect trajectories.
Configuring the Request
var targetFrameTime: CMTime
The requested target frame time for processing trajectory detection.
var trajectoryLength: Int
The number of points to detect before calculating a trajectory.
var objectMinimumNormalizedRadius: Float
The minimum radius of the bounding circle of the object to track.
var objectMaximumNormalizedRadius: Float
The maximum radius of the bounding circle of the object to track.
var minimumObjectSize: Float
The minimum radius of the tracked shape’s bounding circle.
Deprecated
var maximumObjectSize: Float
The maximum radius of the tracked shape’s bounding circle.
Deprecated
Inspecting the Results
var results: [VNTrajectoryObservation]?
The array of detected trajectory observations.
class VNTrajectoryObservation
An observation that describes a detected trajectory.
Identifying Request Revisions
let VNDetectTrajectoriesRequestRevision1: Int
A constant for specifying revision 1 of the trajectories detection request.
