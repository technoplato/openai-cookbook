Instance Property
inverseBindPose
An array of transform matrices, one for each joint, which transform from the authored pose (the “bind pose”) of a model to the local space of that joint.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var inverseBindPose: [simd_float4x4] { get set }
Discussion
Note
The bind pose matrix transforms a joint to the pose of that joint in the model’s bind pose. This property is the inverse bind pose matrix, and thus transforms a joint from its position in the model’s bind pose to the origin.
