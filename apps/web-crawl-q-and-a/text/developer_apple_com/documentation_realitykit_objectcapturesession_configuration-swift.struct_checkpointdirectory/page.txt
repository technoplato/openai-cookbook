Instance Property
checkpointDirectory
An optional directory to store data about session progress which may be used to speed up on-device reconstruction by passing into the PhotogrammetrySession.Configuration. If you provide a value for checkpointDirectory, it also must point to an empty, writable directory. If the directory is not writable or already contains data, the session moves to the .failed(Error) state.
