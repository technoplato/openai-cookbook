Parameters
shape
An integer array. Each element represents the size of the shaped array’s corresponding dimension.
initializer
A closure you provide that initializes the shaped array’s underlying memory. The initializer calls your closure with a pointer to the memory and an array of strides that correspond to the shaped array’s dimensions.
