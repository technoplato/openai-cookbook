Instance Method
tryMin(by:)
Publishes the minimum value received from the upstream publisher, using the provided error-throwing closure to order the items.

func tryMin(by areInIncreasingOrder: @escaping (Self.Output, Self.Output) throws -> Bool) -> Publishers.TryComparison<Self>
Parameters
areInIncreasingOrder
A throwing closure that receives two elements and returns true if they’re in increasing order. If this closure throws, the publisher terminates with a Subscribers/Completion/failure(_:).
Return Value
A publisher that publishes the minimum value received from the upstream publisher, after the upstream publisher finishes.
Discussion
Use Publisher/tryMin(by:) to determine the minimum value of elements received from the upstream publisher using an error-throwing closure you specify.
In the example below, an array publishes elements. The Publisher/tryMin(by:) operator executes the error-throwing closure that throws when the first element is an odd number, terminating the publisher.
struct IllegalValueError: Error {}


let numbers: [Int]  = [0, 10, 6, 13, 22, 22]
numbers.publisher
    .tryMin { first, second -> Bool in
        if (first % 2 != 0) {
            throw IllegalValueError()
        }
        return first < second
    }
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("completion: \($0)") },
        receiveValue: { print ("value: \($0)") }
    )


// Prints: "completion: failure(IllegalValueError())"
After this publisher receives a request for more than 0 items, it requests unlimited items from its upstream publisher.
