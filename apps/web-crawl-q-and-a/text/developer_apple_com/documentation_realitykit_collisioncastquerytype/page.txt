Topics
Collision Cast Queries
case nearest
Report the closest hit.
case all
Report all hits sorted in ascending order by distance from the cast origin.
case any
Report one hit.
Comparing Collision Cast Queries
static func == (CollisionCastQueryType, CollisionCastQueryType) -> Bool
Indicates whether two cast queries are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two cast queries are not equal.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
Hashes the essential components of the cast query by feeding them into the given hash function.
var hashValue: Int
The hashed value of the cast query.

Detecting Intersections
func raycast(origin: SIMD3<Float>, direction: SIMD3<Float>, length: Float, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup, relativeTo: Entity?) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Performs a convex ray cast against all the geometry in the scene for a ray of a given origin, direction, and length.
func raycast(from: SIMD3<Float>, to: SIMD3<Float>, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup, relativeTo: Entity?) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Performs a convex ray cast against all the geometry in the scene for a ray between two end points.
func convexCast(convexShape: ShapeResource, fromPosition: SIMD3<Float>, fromOrientation: simd_quatf, toPosition: SIMD3<Float>, toOrientation: simd_quatf, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup, relativeTo: Entity?) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Performs a convex shape cast against all the geometry in the scene.
struct CollisionCastHit
A hit result of a collision cast.
struct CollisionGroup
A bitmask used to define the collision group to which an entity belongs.
