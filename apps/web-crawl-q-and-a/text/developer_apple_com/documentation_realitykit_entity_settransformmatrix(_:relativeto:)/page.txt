Instance Method
setTransformMatrix(_:relativeTo:)
Sets the transform of the entity relative to the given reference entity using a 4x4 matrix representation.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func setTransformMatrix(
    _ transform: float4x4,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
transform
A 4x4 transform matrix, given relative to referenceEntity.
referenceEntity
The entity that defines a frame of reference. Set this to nil to indicate world space.
Discussion
The Transform component can’t represent all transforms that a general 4x4 matrix can represent. Setting a transform using a 4x4 matrix is therefore a lossy event that might result in certain transformations, like shear, being dropped.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
