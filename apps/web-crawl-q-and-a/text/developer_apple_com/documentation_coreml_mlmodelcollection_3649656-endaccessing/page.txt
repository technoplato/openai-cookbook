    completionHandler handler: @escaping (Result<Void, Error>) -> Void
)

Parameters
identifier
The name of the model collection.
handler
The closure that Core ML calls when it’s finished removing your app’s access to the model collection.
The closure has one Result parameter with the following associated values:
Result.success(_:)
This case has no associated value, which it represents as Void.
Result.failure(_:)
An Error instance if the method failed to end your app’s access to the model collection (see MLModelError).
Discussion
Use this method when your app no longer needs access to a model collection.
MLModelCollection.endAccessing(identifier: modelCollectionName) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success():
        print("Successfully ended access to `\(modelCollectionName)`.")


    case .failure(let error):
        print("Error ending access to `\(modelCollectionName)`: \(error)")
    }
}
