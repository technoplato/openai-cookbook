    _ parent: Entity?,
    preservingWorldTransform: Bool = false
)
Discussion
Attaching an entity to a new parent automatically detaches it from its old parent.
The children collections of both the old and new parent are automatically updated as well.
parent: The new parent entity. Use nil to detach the entity from its current parent.
preservingWorldTransform: A Boolean that you set to true to preserve the entity’s world transform, or false to preserve its relative transform. Use true when you want a model to keep its effective location and size within a scene.
