Instance Method
raycast(origin:direction:length:query:mask:relativeTo:)
Performs a convex ray cast against all the geometry in the scene for a ray of a given origin, direction, and length.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func raycast(
    origin: SIMD3<Float>,
    direction: SIMD3<Float>,
    length: Float = 100,
    query: CollisionCastQueryType = .all,
    mask: CollisionGroup = .all,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity? = nil
) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Parameters
origin
The origin of the ray relative to referenceEntity.
direction
The direction of the ray relative to referenceEntity.
length
The length of the ray relative to referenceEntity.
query
A query type.
Return Value
An array of collision cast hit results. Each hit indicates where the ray, starting at a given point and traveling in a given direction, hit a particular entity in the scene.
Discussion
The method ignores entities that lack a CollisionComponent.
mask: A collision mask that you can use to prevent collisions with certain objects.
referenceEntity: An entity that defines the frame of reference. The method returns results relative to this entity. Set to nil to use the world space origin (0, 0, 0).
The normal property on returned result objects contains the surface normal at the point of intersection with the entity’s collision shape.

func raycast(from: SIMD3<Float>, to: SIMD3<Float>, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup, relativeTo: Entity?) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Performs a convex ray cast against all the geometry in the scene for a ray between two end points.
func convexCast(convexShape: ShapeResource, fromPosition: SIMD3<Float>, fromOrientation: simd_quatf, toPosition: SIMD3<Float>, toOrientation: simd_quatf, query: CollisionCastQueryType, mask: CollisionGroup, relativeTo: Entity?) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Performs a convex shape cast against all the geometry in the scene.
struct CollisionCastHit
A hit result of a collision cast.
enum CollisionCastQueryType
The kinds of ray and convex shape cast queries that you can make.
struct CollisionGroup
A bitmask used to define the collision group to which an entity belongs.
