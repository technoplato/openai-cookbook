Initializer
init(tint:texture:)
Creates a base color object from a color or texture on macOS.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    tint: UIColor = .white,
    texture: MaterialParameters.Texture? = nil
)
Parameters
tint
The tint color. Defaults to white.
texture
An optional image texture.
Discussion
This initializer creates a new instance from a color or image texture, or from both. If you don’t provide a tint color, tint defaults to white.
If you specify texture, RealityKit calculates the final base color for the entity by UV-mapping texture onto the entity and then multiplying the color at any given pixel by tint. If tint is white, RealityKit renders the textured untinted.
If you don’t specify a texture, RealityKit uses tint as the entity’s base color.
