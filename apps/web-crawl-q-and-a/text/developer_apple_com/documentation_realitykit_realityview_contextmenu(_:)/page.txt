func contextMenu<MenuItems>(_ contextMenu: ContextMenu<MenuItems>?) -> some View where MenuItems : View
Parameters
contextMenu
A context menu container for views that you present as menu items in a context menu.
Return Value
A view that can show a context menu.
Discussion
Use this method to attach a specified context menu to a view. You can make the context menu unavailable by conditionally passing nil as the value for the contextMenu.
The example below creates a ContextMenu that contains two items and passes them into the modifier. The Boolean value shouldShowMenu, which defaults to true, controls the context menu availability:
private let menuItems = ContextMenu {
    Button {
        // Add this item to a list of favorites.
    } label: {
        Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
    }
    Button {
        // Open Maps and center it on this item.
    } label: {
        Label("Show in Maps", systemImage: "mappin")
    }
}


private struct ContextMenuMenuItems: View {
    @State private var shouldShowMenu = true


    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .contextMenu(shouldShowMenu ? menuItems : nil)
    }
}
