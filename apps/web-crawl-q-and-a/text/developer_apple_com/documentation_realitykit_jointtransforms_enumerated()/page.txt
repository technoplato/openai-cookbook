func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence<Self>
Return Value
A sequence of pairs enumerating the sequence.
Overview
The format of the pairs is (n, x), where n represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and x represents an element of the sequence.
For more on enumerating the elements of a squence, see doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swift/array/1687832-enumerated.
