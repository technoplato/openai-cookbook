Moves the character instantly to a new position.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func teleportCharacter(
    to position: SIMD3<Float>,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity?
)
Parameters
newPosition
The position, relative to relativeTo to move the character.
relativeTo
Reference Entity which defines the frame of reference of the new position. Can be nil, which is equivalent to “world space”.
Discussion
This method moves the character to a location specified relative to another entity. Pass nil in relativeTo to specify a position in world coordinates. A teleport move happens instantly. RealityKit does no collision checking when it moves the entity.
