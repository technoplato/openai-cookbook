Discussion
This property reflects the overall confidence in the recognition of the entire phrase. The value is 0 if there was no recognition, and it is closer to 1 when there is a high certainty that a transcription matches the user's speech exactly. For example, a confidence value of 0.94 represents a very high confidence level, and is more likely to be correct than a transcription with a confidence value of 0.72.
