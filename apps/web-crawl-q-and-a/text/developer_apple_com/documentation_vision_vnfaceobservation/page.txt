Overview
This type of observation results from a VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest. It contains information about facial landmarks and regions it finds in the image.
Topics
Creating an Observation
init(requestRevision: Int, boundingBox: CGRect, roll: NSNumber?, yaw: NSNumber?, pitch: NSNumber?)
Creates an observation that contains the roll, yaw, and pitch of the face.
init(requestRevision: Int, boundingBox: CGRect, roll: NSNumber?, yaw: NSNumber?)
Creates an observation that contains the roll and yaw of the face.
Deprecated
Identifying Landmarks
var landmarks: VNFaceLandmarks2D?
The facial features of the detected face.
class VNFaceLandmarks2D
A collection of facial features that a request detects.
class VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D
2D geometry information for a specific facial feature.
class VNFaceLandmarks
The abstract superclass for containers of face landmark information.
class VNFaceLandmarkRegion
The abstract superclass for information about a specific face landmark.
Determining Facial Orientation
var roll: NSNumber?
The roll angle of a face in radians.
var yaw: NSNumber?
The yaw angle of a face in radians.
var pitch: NSNumber?
The pitch angle of a face in radians.
Determining Capture Quality
var faceCaptureQuality: Float?
A value that indicates the quality of the face capture.
