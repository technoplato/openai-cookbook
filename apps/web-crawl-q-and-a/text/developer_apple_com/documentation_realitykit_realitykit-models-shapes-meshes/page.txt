Models, shapes, and meshes
Use mesh-based models to display virtual objects in your scene.
Overview
Every object that can be put into a RealityKit scene is an Entity, but not all entities are models. lights, anchors, and spatial sounds are all entities. Model entities are entities that represent rendered objects, including shape primitives like capsules and spheres, and mesh-based models imported from USDZ files.
Topics
Convenience entity
class ModelEntity
A representation of a physical object that RealityKit renders and optionally simulates.
struct ResolvedModel3D
A view for displaying static three-dimensional models.
Beta
Model component
struct ModelComponent
A collection of resources that create the visual appearance of an entity.
struct ModelDebugOptionsComponent
A component that changes how RealityKit renders its entity to help with debugging.
protocol HasModel
An interface that provides meshes and materials to define the visual appearance of an entity.
Primitive shapes
class ShapeResource
A representation of a shape.
Mesh resources
class MeshResource
A high-level representation of a collection of vertices and edges that define a shape.
struct MeshPartCollection
An object that holds a collection of mesh parts.
struct MeshInstanceCollection
An object that holds a collection of mesh resource instances.
struct MeshModelCollection
An object that holds a collection of mesh models.
Mutable mesh buffers
struct MeshBuffer
Mesh buffer containing elements of any type.
struct MeshDescriptor
An object that defines a mesh.
struct AnyMeshBuffer
Mesh buffer stored in the container.
protocol MeshBufferContainer
Conforming objects contain a table of mesh buffers.
protocol MeshBufferSemantic
A protocol that holds an identifier value for mesh buffers.
Common types
protocol Resource
A shared resource you use to configure a component, like a material, mesh, or texture.
enum Model3DPhase
The current phase of the asynchronous model loading operation.
