Presents a system interface for allowing the user to export a FileDocument to a file on disk.
RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 17.0+ Beta

macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileExporter<D>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    document: D?,
    contentTypes: [UTType] = [],
    defaultFilename: String? = nil,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<URL, Error>) -> Void,
    onCancellation: @escaping () -> Void = {}
) -> some View where D : FileDocument
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the interface should be shown.
document
The in-memory document to export.
contentTypes
The list of supported content types which can be exported. If not provided, FileDocument.writableContentTypes are used.
defaultFilename
If provided, the default name to use for the exported file, which will the user will have an opportunity to edit prior to the export.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has succeeded or failed. The result indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed.
onCancellation
A callback that will be invoked if the user cancels the operation.
Discussion
In order for the interface to appear, isPresented must be true. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCancellation will be called.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
