Instance Method
generateCollisionShapes(recursive:)
Creates the shape used to detect collisions between two entities that have collision components.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func generateCollisionShapes(recursive: Bool)
Parameters
recursive
A Boolean that you set to true to also generate the collision shapes for all descendants of the entity.
Discussion
Call this method on entities that adopt the HasModel and HasCollision protocols to prepare a shape used for collision detection. The method stores the shape in the entity’s CollisionComponent instance.
For non-model entities, the method has no effect. Nevertheless, the method is defined for all entities so that you can call it on any entity, and have the calculation propagate recursively to all that entity’s descendants.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
