When a collision object is dynamic (not static), it reports collisions with other collision objects.

static let `static`: CollisionComponent.CollisionOptions
Discussion
When a collision object is static, it doesn’t report collisions with static collision objects, only with dynamic collision objects.
Note
Static collision objects are more light-weight and improve performance. They should be used where collisions are tested against these objects, not between these objects.
