Initializer
init(frames:name:tweenMode:frameInterval:isAdditive:bindTarget:blendLayer:repeatMode:fillMode:trimStart:trimEnd:trimDuration:offset:delay:speed:)
Creates an animation with a collection of frames that represent incremental steps in the overall timeline.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    frames: [Value],
    name: String = "",
    tweenMode: TweenMode = .linear,
    frameInterval: Float = 1.0 / 30.0,
    isAdditive: Bool = false,
    bindTarget: BindTarget? = nil,
    blendLayer: Int32 = 0,
    repeatMode: AnimationRepeatMode = .none,
    fillMode: AnimationFillMode = [],
    trimStart: TimeInterval? = nil,
    trimEnd: TimeInterval? = nil,

)
Parameters
frames
An array of values in which each element represents a discrete state of the animated property at a given point in the animation’s timeline.
name
A textual name for the animation.
tweenMode
An option that determines how animation frames transition.
frameInterval
The duration within the animation timeline for each frame in the frames array.
isAdditive
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
bindTarget
A textual name that identifies the particular property that animates.
blendLayer
The order in which the framework composites the animation into the view.
repeatMode
An option that determines how the animation repeats.
fillMode
The playback behavior outside of the normal duration.
trimStart
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation plays.
trimEnd
The optional time, in seconds, at which the animation stops.
trimDuration
An optional duration that overrides the calculated duration.
offset
The time, in seconds, at which the animation begins within the duration.
delay
An amount of time that lapses before the animation plays.
speed
A factor that changes the animation’s rate of playback.
