func onChange<V>(
    of value: V,
    initial: Bool = false,
    _ action: @escaping () -> Void
) -> some View where V : Equatable
Parameters
value
The value to check against when determining whether to run the closure.
initial
Whether the action should be run when this view initially appears.
action
A closure to run when the value changes.
Return Value
A view that fires an action when the specified value changes.
Discussion
You can use onChange to trigger a side effect as the result of a value changing, such as an Environment key or a Binding.
The system may call the action closure on the main actor, so avoid long-running tasks in the closure. If you need to perform such tasks, detach an asynchronous background task.
When the value changes, the new version of the closure will be called, so any captured values will have their values from the time that the observed value has its new value. In the following code example, PlayerView calls into its model when playState changes model.
struct PlayerView: View {
    var episode: Episode
    @State private var playState: PlayState = .paused


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(episode.title)
            Text(episode.showTitle)
            PlayButton(playState: $playState)
        }
        .onChange(of: playState) {
            model.playStateDidChange(state: playState)
        }
    }
}
