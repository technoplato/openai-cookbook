Discussion
There are two Image Feature Print revisions: 1 and 2. In most cases revision 2 produces better models because it uses a smaller feature vector and better features.
In iOS 12 or later, tvOS 12 or later, and macOS 10.14 or later, revision 1 takes images with a size of 299x299 and produces a 2048 feature vector.
In iOS 17 or later, tvOS 17 or later, and macOS 14 or later, revision 2 takes images with a size of 360x360 and produces a 768 feature vector.
