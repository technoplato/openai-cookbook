func phaseAnimator<Phase>(
    _ phases: some Sequence,
    trigger: some Equatable,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (PlaceholderContentView<Self>, Phase) -> some View,
    animation: @escaping (Phase) -> Animation? = { _ in .default }
) -> some View where Phase : Equatable
Parameters
phases
Phases defining the states that will be cycled through. This sequence must not be empty. If an empty sequence is provided, a visual warning will be displayed in place of this view, and a warning will be logged.
trigger
A value to observe for changes.
content
A view builder closure that takes two parameters. The first parameter is a proxy value representing the modified view. The second parameter is the current phase.
animation
A closure that returns the animation to use when transitioning to the next phase. If nil is returned, the transition will not be animated.
Discussion
The phases that you provide specify the individual values that will be animated to when the trigger value changes.
When the view first appears, the value from the first phase is provided to the content closure. When the trigger value changes, the content closure is called with the value from the second phase and its corresponding animation. This continues until the last phase is reached, after which the first phase is animated to.
