Overview
Path-based instances of bindTarget, or those identified by the BindTarget.path(_:) call, consist of one or more components identified by these enumeration options.
For example, the succession of BindPath.Part calls in the following code results in a path with a parts array that contains three components: entityA, entityB, and myInt.
let target3: BindTarget = .entity("entityA").entity("entityB").parameter("myInt")
Topics
Choosing the Path Component
case anchorEntity(String)
A path component for the scene’s anchor entity.
case entity(String)
A path component for a nested entity.
case jointTransforms
A path component to animate joint transforms.
case parameter(String)
A path component to animate a named parameter.
case scene(String)
A path component for a nested scene.
case transform
A path component to animate a transform.
Comparing Bind Parts
static func == (BindPath.Part, BindPath.Part) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two components of a bind path are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether two components of a bind path aren’t equal.
Enumeration Cases
case material(Int)
case materialParameter(String)
case opacity
An path component to animate an opacity. Requires that the entity has an OpacityComponent
