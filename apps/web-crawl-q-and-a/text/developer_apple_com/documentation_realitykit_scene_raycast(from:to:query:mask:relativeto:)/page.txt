Instance Method
raycast(from:to:query:mask:relativeTo:)
Performs a convex ray cast against all the geometry in the scene for a ray between two end points.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func raycast(
    from startPosition: SIMD3<Float>,
    to endPosition: SIMD3<Float>,
    query: CollisionCastQueryType = .all,
    mask: CollisionGroup = .all,
    relativeTo referenceEntity: Entity? = nil
) -> [CollisionCastHit]
Return Value
An array of collision cast hit results. Each hit indicates where the ray, starting at startPosition and ending at endPosition, hit a particular entity in the scene.
Discussion
The method ignores entities that lack a CollisionComponent.
startPosition: The start position of the ray relative to referenceEntity.
endPosition: The end position of the ray relative to referenceEntity.
query: A query type.
mask: A collision mask that you can use to prevent collisions with certain objects.
referenceEntity: An entity that defines the frame of reference. The method returns results relative to this entity. Set to nil to use the world space origin (0, 0, 0).
