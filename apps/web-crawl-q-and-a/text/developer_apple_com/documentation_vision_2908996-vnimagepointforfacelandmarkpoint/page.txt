func VNImagePointForFaceLandmarkPoint(
    _ faceLandmarkPoint: vector_float2,
    _ faceBoundingBox: CGRect,
    _ imageWidth: Int,
    _ imageHeight: Int
) -> CGPoint
Parameters
faceLandmarkPoint
The location of the face landmark, as returned from a VNFaceLandmarkRegion2D instance.
faceBoundingBox
The normalized bounding box rect around the face, as obtained from a VNFaceObservation.
imageWidth
The width of the image from which the VNFaceObservation was generated.
imageHeight
The height of the image from which the VNFaceObservation was generated.
Return Value
The input face landmark point, projected into image coordinates.
Discussion
The resulting point in image coordinate space may have nonintegral (floating-point) coordinates.
