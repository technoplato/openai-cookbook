@MainActor
func didClone(from source: Entity)
Parameters
source
The entity from which the cloned entity was copied.
Discussion
This method clones all component data automatically. When you clone an entity that stores custom data that’s not part of a component, override the didClone(from:) method to copy that data manually after the clone finishes.
