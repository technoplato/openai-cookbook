func joined<Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence<Self> where Separator : Sequence, Separator.Element == Self.Element.Element
Parameters
separator
A sequence to insert between each of this sequence’s elements.
Return Value
The joined sequence of elements.
Discussion
This example shows how an array of [Int] instances can be joined, using another [Int] instance as the separator:
let nestedNumbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
let joined = nestedNumbers.joined(separator: [-1, -2])
print(Array(joined))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, -1, -2, 4, 5, 6, -1, -2, 7, 8, 9]"

Splitting and Joining Rows
func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [Self.SubSequence]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, around elements equal to the given element.
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.SubSequence]
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate.
