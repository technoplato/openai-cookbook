struct CustomContent
A CustomContent struct contains the accessibility strings for the labels you apply to your accessibility content.
Identifying the next element
var customRotors: [AccessibilityComponent.RotorType]
An array of supported rotors.
var customRotorsRawValue: [AccessibilityComponent.RotorTypeInternal]
An array of supported rotors.
enum RotorType
A context-sensitive event that helps VoiceOver users find the next instance of a related element.
