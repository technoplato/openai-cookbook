struct CollisionFilter
Overview
Use Collision filters in combination with collision groups to define which entities collide with which other entities in a scene. For more information on using collision filters, see CollisionGroup
Topics
Creating a Collision Filter
init(group: CollisionGroup, mask: CollisionGroup)
Creates a collision filter.
static let `default`: CollisionFilter
The default collision filter.
static let sensor: CollisionFilter
A collision filter for an entity that collides with everything.
Customizing Groups
var group: CollisionGroup
The collision group or groups, stored as a bit mask, to which the entity belongs.
var mask: CollisionGroup
The collision group or groups, stored as a bitmask, with which the entity can collide.
struct CollisionGroup
A bitmask used to define the collision group to which an entity belongs.
Comparing Collision Filters
static func == (CollisionFilter, CollisionFilter) -> Bool
Indicates whether two collision filters are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two collision filters are not equal.
