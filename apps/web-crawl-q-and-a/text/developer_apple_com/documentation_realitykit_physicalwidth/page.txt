physicalWidth
An image’s width in centimeters.
Overview
This property informs the runtime how wide the image is in the physical environment. The runtime calculates the height based on the image’s aspect ratio.
Because this property describes a real-world width, the prim’s transform hierarchy doesn’t modify this property’s value.
Declaration
uniform double physicalWidth
Define a Reference Image’s Width
To recognize an image in the real world, the runtime requires a prim to specify how wide the image is in the physical environment.
def Preliminary_ReferenceImage "ImageReference"
{
    uniform double physicalWidth = 12
    ...
}
