struct MLClassifierMetrics
Overview
Use MLClassifierMetrics to evaluate your model’s ability to distinguish between different categories when it’s classifying data.
You can determine the model’s accuracy using the classificationError metric. For information about how your model is mislabeling or missing a certain category, use the precisionRecall metric. To determine specific cases where your model is mistaking one label for another, use the confusion property.
Accuracy can be a misleading metric if you use unbalanced data, which means the number of examples for some categories are much larger than others. Instead, use precisionRecall or confusion.
Note
Each trained model contains different metrics for its various data sets (training, validation, and testing). Improving Your Model’s Accuracy compares these metrics between different data sets.
Topics
Understanding the Model
var classificationError: Double
The fraction of incorrectly labeled examples.
var precisionRecall: MLDataTable
A data table listing the precision and recall percentages for each class.
var confusion: MLDataTable
A table comparing the actual and predicted labels for each classification category.
Handling Errors
var isValid: Bool
A Boolean value indicating whether the classifier model was able to calculate metrics.
var error: (Error)?
The underlying error present when the metrics are invalid.
Creating Metrics
init(classificationError: Double, confusion: MLDataTable, precisionRecall: MLDataTable)
Creates empty classifier metrics.
Describing Metrics
var description: String
A text representation of the classifier metrics.
var debugDescription: String
A text representation of the classifier metrics that’s suitable for output during debugging.
var playgroundDescription: Any
A description of the classifier metrics shown in a playground.
Instance Properties
var confusionDataFrame: DataFrame
A data frame comparing the actual and predicted labels for each class.
Beta
var precisionRecallDataFrame: DataFrame
A data frame listing the precision and recall percentages for each class.
