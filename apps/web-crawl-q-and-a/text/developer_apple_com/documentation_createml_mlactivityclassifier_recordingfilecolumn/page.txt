Instance Property
recordingFileColumn
The name of the column that contains the data files the activity classifier used during its training session.
macOS 10.15+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var recordingFileColumn: String
Discussion
This property reflects the name of the data table column or annotation file column the training session used to locate each activity’s data files.
Note
The MLActivityClassifier instance provides a default name if you trained it with a data source that’s set to MLActivityClassifier.DataSource.labeledDirectories(at:).
Changing the value of this property doesn’t retrain the model or affect its behavior.
