Instance Property
featureExtractionTimeWindowSize
A time duration, in seconds, that determines how much audio data the feature-extraction session reads each time it samples an audio file.

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var featureExtractionTimeWindowSize: TimeInterval { get set }
Discussion
The time-window size defaults to 0.975 seconds and must be in the range [0.5, 15.0].
Feature-extraction sessions that use MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType.vggish(revision:) ignore this value and always use a time-window size of 0.975 seconds.
See Also
Accessing Feature Extraction Parameters
var overlapFactor: Double
The proportion of overlap that the feature-extraction session uses to analyze two consecutive windows in the audio data.
var featureExtractor: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.FeatureExtractorType
The algorithm type the session uses to extract features from audio files.
