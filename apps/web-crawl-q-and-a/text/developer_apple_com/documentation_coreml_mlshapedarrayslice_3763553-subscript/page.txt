Accessing an Element
var scalar: Scalar?
A computed property that returns the first element when the shape isn’t empty, or sets the shaped array’s underlying scalar type.
var scalars: [Scalar]
A computed property that generates a linear array that contains every element, or assigns the elements of an array to the shaped array’s elements.
subscript(scalarAt: Int...) -> Scalar
Accesses an element in the shaped array using a list of indices that represent a multidimensional location.
