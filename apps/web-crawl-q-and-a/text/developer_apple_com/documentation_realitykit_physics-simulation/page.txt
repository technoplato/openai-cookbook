Physics simulation
Simulate physical interactions between entities.
Overview
RealityKit simulates physical interactions between virtual objects in your scene, as well as between virtual objects and detected surfaces in the real world, such as floors, walls, or tabletops. On iOS devices with a LiDAR Scanner, RealityKit can even simulate interactions between virtual objects and scanned real-world geometry.
Topics
Physics interaction
Designing Scene Hierarchies for Efficient Physics Simulation
Configure your RealityKit scenes to avoid performance bottlenecks.
Handling Different-Sized Objects in Physics Simulations
Set up a scene hierarchy for accurate physics simulations.
