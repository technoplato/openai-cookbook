Initializer
init(id:jointNames:inverseBindPoseMatrices:restPoseTransforms:parentIndices:)
Creates a skeleton from arrays which define its joints. Returns nil if there was an issue converting the parameters to a valid skeleton.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init?(
    id: String,
    jointNames: [String],
    inverseBindPoseMatrices: [simd_float4x4],
    restPoseTransforms: [Transform]? = nil,
    parentIndices: [Int?]? = nil
)
Parameters
id
The unique name of this skeleton.
jointNames
The names of each joint.
inverseBindPoseMatrices
The matrix which, for each joint, transforms from model space (bind pose) to the local space of that joint.
restPoseTransforms
The transform from each joint’s local space to its parent’s local space, used when the joint is not animated. If not specified, the rest pose is assumed to be the same as the bind pose, and is computed from the inverse bind pose matrices.
parentIndices
The index of each joint’s parent, or nil if that joint has no parent. If this array is not provided, the parent of each joint is inferred from its name (e.g. a joint named root/hips_joint is parented to a joint named root).
Discussion
Note
A parent joint must precede all of its child joints. Note: All the arrays passed to this initializer must have the same length.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
