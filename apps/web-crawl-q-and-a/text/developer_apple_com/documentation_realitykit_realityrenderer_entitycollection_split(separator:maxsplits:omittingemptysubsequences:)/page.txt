Instance Method
split(separator:maxSplits:omittingEmptySubsequences:)
Returns the longest possible subsequences of the collection, in order, around elements equal to the given element.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func split(
    separator: Self.Element,
    maxSplits: Int = Int.max,
    omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool = true
) -> [Self.SubSequence]
Available when Element conforms to Equatable.
Parameters
separator
The element that should be split upon.
maxSplits
The maximum number of times to split the collection, or one less than the number of subsequences to return. If maxSplits + 1 subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original collection containing the remaining elements. maxSplits must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is Int.max.
omittingEmptySubsequences
If false, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each consecutive pair of separator elements in the collection and for each instance of separator at the start or end of the collection. If true, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is true.
Return Value
An array of subsequences, split from this collection’s elements.
Discussion
The resulting array consists of at most maxSplits + 1 subsequences. Elements that are used to split the collection are not returned as part of any subsequence.
The following examples show the effects of the maxSplits and omittingEmptySubsequences parameters when splitting a string at each space character (” “). The first use of split returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.
let line = "BLANCHE:   I don't want realism. I want magic!"
print(line.split(separator: " "))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
The second example passes 1 for the maxSplits parameter, so the original string is split just once, into two new strings.
print(line.split(separator: " ", maxSplits: 1))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "  I don\'t want realism. I want magic!"]"
The final example passes false for the omittingEmptySubsequences parameter, so the returned array contains empty strings where spaces were repeated.
print(line.split(separator: " ", omittingEmptySubsequences: false))
// Prints "["BLANCHE:", "", "", "I", "don\'t", "want", "realism.", "I", "want", "magic!"]"
Complexity
O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
