Operators
static func == (MeshResource.Skeleton.Joint, MeshResource.Skeleton.Joint) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Initializers
init(name: String, parentIndex: Int?, inverseBindPoseMatrix: simd_float4x4, restPoseTransform: Transform)
Creates a single joint in a skeleton.
Instance Properties
var inverseBindPoseMatrix: simd_float4x4
A matrix which transforms from the authored pose (the “bind pose”) of the bound model to the local space of this joint.
var name: String
The name of this joint. Must be unique within its skeleton.
var parentIndex: Int?
The index of this joint’s parent, or nil if this joint has no parent.
var restPoseTransform: Transform
The local transform of this joint in skeleton’s rest pose, specified relative to this joint’s parent (or relative to model space, if this joint has no parent).
