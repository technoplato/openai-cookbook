PerspectiveCameraComponent
In AR applications, the camera is automatically provided by the system. In non-AR scenarios, the camera needs to be set by the app. (If no camera is provided by the app, the system will use default camera.)

Topics
Creating a Camera Component
init(near: Float, far: Float, fieldOfViewInDegrees: Float)
Creates a new perspective camera component with the given settings.
Setting Focal Points
var far: Float
The maximum distance in meters from the camera that the camera can see.
var near: Float
The minimum distance in meters from the camera that the camera can see.
Setting the Field of View
var fieldOfViewInDegrees: Float
The camera’s total vertical field of view in degrees.
Registering a Component Type
static func registerComponent()
Registers a new component type.
Comparing Perspective Camera Components
static func == (PerspectiveCameraComponent, PerspectiveCameraComponent) -> Bool
Indicates whether two perspective camera components are equal.
static func != (Self, Self) -> Bool
Indicates whether two perspective camera components are not equal.
