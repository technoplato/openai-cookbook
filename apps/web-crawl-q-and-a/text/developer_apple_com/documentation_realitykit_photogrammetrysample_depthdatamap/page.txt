var depthDataMap: CVPixelBuffer?
Discussion
Some cameras, including iPhone cameras, capture depth data in addition to image data. Providing this data can help PhotogrammetrySession determine the real-world scale of the photographed object and result in a correctly sized 3D object for placement in an AR scene. This property is read-only.
Depth data can be in either kCVPixelFormatType_DisparityFloat32 or kCVPixelFormatType_DepthFloat32 format.
