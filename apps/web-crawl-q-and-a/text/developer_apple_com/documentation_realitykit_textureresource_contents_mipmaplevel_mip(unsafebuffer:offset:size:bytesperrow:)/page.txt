Swift
Type Method
mip(unsafeBuffer:offset:size:bytesPerRow:)
Specifies a single mipmap level of a texture resource with pixel data copied from a Metal buffer.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
static func mip(
    unsafeBuffer buffer: MTLBuffer,
    offset: Int = 0,
    size: Int,
    bytesPerRow: Int
) -> TextureResource.Contents.MipmapLevel
Parameters
buffer
The source buffer. This buffer must not be modified while being used as the source of a copy operation.
offset
The byte position in the source buffer where the copying starts. The offset must be a multiple of the destination texture’s pixel size, in bytes.
size
The number of bytes in the source buffer (starting from offset) available for copying.
bytesPerRow
The stride in bytes between rows of texture data stored in the source buffer. The value must be a multiple of the destination texture’s pixel size, in bytes.
Discussion
Important
A TextureResource.Contents.MipmapLevel created with this function and used to create a TextureResource will copy from the source buffer. That copy occurs when the TextureResource is initialized. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the source Metal buffer is not modified while it is being copied to a texture.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
