func background(ignoresSafeAreaEdges edges: Edge.Set = .all) -> some View
Parameters
edges
The set of edges for which to ignore safe area insets when adding the background. The default value is Edge/Set/all. Specify an empty set to respect safe area insets on all edges.
Return Value
A view with the ShapeStyle/background shape style drawn behind it.
Discussion
This modifier behaves like View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:), except that it always uses the ShapeStyle/background shape style. For example, you can add a background to a Label:
ZStack {
    Color.teal
    Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
        .padding()
        .background()
}
Without the background modifier, the teal color behind the label shows through the label. With the modifier, the label’s text and icon appear backed by a region filled with a color that’s appropriate for light or dark appearance:
If you want to specify a View or a stack of views as the background, use View/background(alignment:content:) instead. To specify a Shape or InsettableShape, use View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j or View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-20tq5, respectively. To configure the background of a presentation, like a sheet, use View/presentationBackground(_:).
