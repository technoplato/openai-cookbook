RealityKit
SwiftUI
iOS 15.0+

macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func foregroundStyle<S1, S2, S3>(
    _ primary: S1,
    _ secondary: S2,
    _ tertiary: S3
) -> some View where S1 : ShapeStyle, S2 : ShapeStyle, S3 : ShapeStyle
Parameters
primary
The primary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements. To indicate a specific value, use Color or ShapeStyle/image(_:sourceRect:scale:), or one of the gradient types, like ShapeStyle/linearGradient(colors:startPoint:endPoint:). To set a style that’s relative to the containing view’s style, use one of the semantic styles, like ShapeStyle/primary.
secondary
The secondary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements.
tertiary
The tertiary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements.
Return Value
A view that uses the given foreground styles.
Discussion
SwiftUI uses these styles when rendering child views that don’t have an explicit rendering style, like images, text, shapes, and so on.
Symbol images within the view hierarchy use the SymbolRenderingMode/palette rendering mode when you apply this modifier, if you don’t explicitly specify another mode.
