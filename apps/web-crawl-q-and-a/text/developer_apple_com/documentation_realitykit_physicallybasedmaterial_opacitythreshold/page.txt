var opacityThreshold: Float? { get set }
Discussion
When blending is transparent, this value controls how the opacity value affects rendering. The default opacityThreshold value of 0.0 indicates that the opacity values render at the specified transparency, with 0.0 rendered fully transparent, 1.0 rendered fully opaque, and values between 0.0 and 1.0 rendering partially transparent.
If opacityThreshold is greater than 0.0, RealityKit doesn’t render opacity values less than the opacityThreshold at all, and renders opacity values greater than or equal to opacityThreshold fully opaque.
When blending is opaque, RealityKit ignores this value.
