Topics
Creating a Vector
init(byAdding: VNVector, to: VNVector)
Creates a new vector by adding the specified vectors.
init(bySubtracting: VNVector, from: VNVector)
Creates a new vector by subtracting the first vector from the second vector.
init(byMultiplying: VNVector, byScalar: Double)
Creates a new vector by multiplying the specified vector’s x-axis and y-axis projections by the scalar value.
init(r: Double, theta: Double)
Creates a new vector in polar coordinate space.
init(vectorHead: VNPoint, tail: VNPoint)
Creates a new vector in Cartesian coordinate space.
init(xComponent: Double, yComponent: Double)
Creates a new vector in Cartesian coordinate space, based on its x-axis and y-axis projections.
class var zero: VNVector
A vector object with zero length.
Inspecting a Vector
var length: Double
The length, or absolute value, of the vector.
var r: Double
The radius, absolute value, or length of the vector.
var theta: Double
The angle between the vector direction and the positive direction of the x-axis.
var squaredLength: Double
The squared length of the vector.
var x: Double
A signed projection that indicates the vector’s direction on the x-axis.
var y: Double
A signed projection that indicates the vector’s direction on the y-axis.
class func dotProduct(of: VNVector, vector: VNVector) -> Double
Caclulates the dot product of two vectors.
class func unitVector(for: VNVector) -> VNVector
Calculates a vector that’s normalized by preserving its direction, so that the vector length equals 1.0.
