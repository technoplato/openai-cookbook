Initializer
init(validation:maxIterations:overlapFactor:)
Creates a new set of training parameters for a sound classifier with a validation dataset.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    validation: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData = .split(strategy: .automatic),
    maxIterations: Int = 25,
    overlapFactor: Double = 0.5
)
Parameters
validation
A validation dataset represented by an MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData instance.
maxIterations
The largest number of iterations the training session can use to train the sound classifier.
overlapFactor
A proportion of overlap the training session uses to analyze two consecutive windows in the audio data. The proportion must be in the range [0.0, 1.0). Higher proportions generate more training data, but also increases the training time.
The default value is 0.5, which represents a 50% overlap.

Creating Parameters
init(validation: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData, maxIterations: Int, overlapFactor: Double, algorithm: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ModelAlgorithmType)
Creates a new set of training parameters for a sound classifier with a validation dataset and a training algorithm.
init(validation: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ValidationData, maxIterations: Int, overlapFactor: Double, algorithm: MLSoundClassifier.ModelParameters.ModelAlgorithmType, featureExtractionTimeWindowSize: TimeInterval)
Creates a new set of training parameters for a sound classifier with a validation dataset, a training algorithm, and a time-window size.
