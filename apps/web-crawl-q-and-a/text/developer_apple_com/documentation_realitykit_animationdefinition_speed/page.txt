Discussion
The default value is 1.0, which doesn’t alter the animation’s duration. A value of 2.0 indicates that the duration is half the normal rate. A value of 0.5 indicates that the duration is twice the normal rate. Negative values play the animation in reverse.
This property doesn’t affect the animation’s delay.
