Initializers
init(id: String, materialIndex: Int)
Create a new part.
Instance Properties
var buffers: [MeshBuffers.Identifier : AnyMeshBuffer]
Descriptors for the buffers.
var id: String
The stable identity of the entity associated with this instance.
var jointInfluences: MeshResource.JointInfluences?
A buffer of vertex-joint influences which defines how the mesh deforms in response to the skeleton that it is bound to. Each vertex may be influenced by one or more joints defined by the skeleton.
Beta
var materialIndex: Int
Material index for the part.
var skeletonID: String?
Identifier of the skeleton that this mesh part is bound to (if it is skinned).
Beta
var triangleIndices: MeshBuffers.TriangleIndices?
Index buffer for triangles.
Subscripts
subscript<S>(S) -> MeshBuffer<S.Element>?
The buffer for a given semantic. There can only be one buffer for any given ID.
Type Aliases
typealias ID
A type representing the stable identity of the entity associated with an instance.
