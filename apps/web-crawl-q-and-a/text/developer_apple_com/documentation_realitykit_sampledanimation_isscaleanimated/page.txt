Instance Property
isScaleAnimated
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation observes changes in the entity’s size.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var isScaleAnimated: Bool { get set }
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
Discussion
If you set this property to true, the animation accommodates scale differences in the entity’s transform by interpolating to the target scale across the animation timeline.

var isTranslationAnimated: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation observes translational changes in the entity’s transform.
Available when Value is JointTransforms.
var additive: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation builds on the current state of the target entity or resets the state before running.
var tweenMode: TweenMode
An option that determines how animation frames transition.
