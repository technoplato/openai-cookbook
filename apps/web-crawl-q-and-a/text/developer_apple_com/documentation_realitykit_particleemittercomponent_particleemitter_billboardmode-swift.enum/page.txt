Enumeration
ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.BillboardMode
Options for specifying the axis about which the particle will be oriented, used by the billboardMode property.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
enum BillboardMode
Topics
Operators
static func == (ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.BillboardMode, ParticleEmitterComponent.ParticleEmitter.BillboardMode) -> Bool
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.
Enumeration Cases
case billboard
Each particle is oriented to always face the camera.
case billboardYAligned
Each particle is oriented to face the camera but remains fixed about the Y axis
case free(axis: SIMD3<Float>, variation: Float)
The axis about which the particle will be oriented is the given axis. The variation is a unit multiplier that determines how far from the given axis the particle is allowed to actually be oriented.
Initializers
init(from: Decoder) throws

Instance Properties
var hashValue: Int
The hash value.
Instance Methods
func encode(to: Encoder) throws
Encodes this value into the given encoder.
func hash(into: inout Hasher)
