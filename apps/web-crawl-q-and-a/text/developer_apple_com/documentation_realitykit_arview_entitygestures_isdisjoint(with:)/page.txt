func isDisjoint(with other: Self) -> Bool
Parameters
other
A set of the same type as the current set.
Return Value
true if the set has no elements in common with other; otherwise, false.
Overview
In the following example, the employees set is disjoint with the visitors set because no name appears in both sets.
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let visitors: Set = ["Marcia", "Nathaniel", "Olivia"]
print(employees.isDisjoint(with: visitors))
// Prints "true"
