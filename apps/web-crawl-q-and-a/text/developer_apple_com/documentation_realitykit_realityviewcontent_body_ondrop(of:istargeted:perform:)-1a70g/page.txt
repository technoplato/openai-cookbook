func onDrop(
    of supportedContentTypes: [UTType],
    isTargeted: Binding<Bool>?,
    perform action: @escaping ([NSItemProvider], CGPoint) -> Bool
) -> some View
Parameters
supportedContentTypes
The uniform type identifiers that describe the types of content this view can accept through drag and drop. If the drag and drop operation doesn’t contain any of the supported types, then this drop destination doesn’t activate and isTargeted doesn’t update.
isTargeted
A binding that updates when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The binding’s value is true when the cursor is inside the area, and false when the cursor is outside.
action
A closure that takes the dropped content and responds appropriately. The first parameter to action contains the dropped items, with types specified by supportedContentTypes. The second parameter contains the drop location in this view’s coordinate space. Return true if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return false.
Return Value
A view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified types.
Discussion
The drop destination is the same size and position as this view.
