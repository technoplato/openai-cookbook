init<Predicted, Correct>(
    predicted: Predicted,
    groundTruth: Correct,
    labels: Set<Label>
) where Label == Predicted.Element, Predicted : Sequence, Correct : Sequence, Predicted.Element == Correct.Element
Discussion
The predicted and ground truth collections are matched element by element in the order they are provided. Both collections must have the same number of elements. Labels not in the labels set are ignored.
Parameters
predicted: The predicted labels.
groundTruth: The true labels.
labels: The set of labels to consider.
