Swift
Generic Instance Method
shuffle(using:)
Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
Xcode 13.0+
mutating func shuffle<T>(using generator: inout T) where T : RandomNumberGenerator
Parameters
generator
The random number generator to use when shuffling the collection.
Discussion
You use this method to randomize the elements of a collection when you are using a custom random number generator. For example, you can use the shuffle(using:) method to randomly reorder the elements of an array.
var names = ["Alejandro", "Camila", "Diego", "Luciana", "Luis", "Sofía"]
names.shuffle(using: &myGenerator)
// names == ["Sofía", "Alejandro", "Camila", "Luis", "Diego", "Luciana"]
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.
Note
The algorithm used to shuffle a collection may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same shuffled order each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.
