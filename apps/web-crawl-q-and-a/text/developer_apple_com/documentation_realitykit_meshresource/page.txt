Topics
Creating a Mesh Resource
static func generate(from: MeshResource.Contents) throws -> MeshResource
Create a mesh resource from contents.
static func generate(from: [MeshDescriptor]) throws -> MeshResource
Create a mesh resource from a list of mesh descriptors.
static func generateAsync(from: MeshResource.Contents) -> LoadRequest<MeshResource>
Create a mesh resource from contents asynchronously.
static func generateAsync(from: [MeshDescriptor]) -> LoadRequest<MeshResource>
Create a mesh resource from a list of mesh descriptors asynchronously.
Configuring the Resource
var expectedMaterialCount: Int
The number of material entries required to render the mesh resource.
func replace(with: MeshResource.Contents) throws
Replace the contents of this mesh resource.
func replaceAsync(with: MeshResource.Contents) -> LoadRequest<MeshResource>
Replace the contents of this mesh resource asynchronously.
Accessing Resource Data
var contents: MeshResource.Contents
Get the contents of the mesh asset.
struct Contents
Value of the contents of the resource.
Getting a Bounding Box
var bounds: BoundingBox
A box that bounds the mesh.
struct BoundingBox
An axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).
struct OrientedBoundingBox
Representation for an oriented bounding box. Uses a combination of an axis-aligned bounding box and a rotation vector around the centroid of the said axis-aligned bounding box to represent an oriented bounding box.
Creating a Box
static func generateBox(size: Float, cornerRadius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new box mesh with sides of equal length.
static func generateBox(size: SIMD3<Float>, cornerRadius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new box mesh with the given dimensions.
static func generateBox(width: Float, height: Float, depth: Float, cornerRadius: Float, splitFaces: Bool) -> MeshResource
Creates a new box mesh with the given dimensions and other characteristics.
Creating a Plane
static func generatePlane(width: Float, height: Float, cornerRadius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new rectangle mesh with the specified dimensions in the entity’s XY-plane.
static func generatePlane(width: Float, depth: Float, cornerRadius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new rectangle mesh with the specified dimensions in the entity’s XZ-plane.
Creating a Sphere
static func generateSphere(radius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new sphere mesh with the specified radius.
Creating Text
typealias Font
A platform-specific type that represents a font for use in generating a text mesh.
Structures
struct Instance
An object that transforms a model to a location.
struct JointInfluences
A buffer of vertex-joint influences which bind the mesh part’s vertices to a skeleton via a skinning deformation.
Beta
struct Model
A model consists of a list of parts.
struct Part
A part of a model consisting of a single material.
struct Skeleton
A skeleton consists of a hierarchy of joints. Each joint defines a coordinate space. Portions of a model may be thought of as having a position in a joint’s local space.

Type Methods
static func generate(from: MeshResource.Contents) async throws -> MeshResource
static func generate(from: [MeshDescriptor]) async throws -> MeshResource
static func generateBoxWithRoundedCorners(size: SIMD3<Float>, majorRadius: Float, minorRadius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new box with rounded corners mesh with the specified extent.
Beta
static func generateCone(height: Float, radius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new cone mesh with the specified dimensions.
Beta
static func generateCylinder(height: Float, radius: Float) -> MeshResource
Creates a new cylinder mesh with the specified dimensions.
Beta
static func generateText(String, extrusionDepth: Float, font: MeshResource.Font, containerFrame: CGRect, alignment: CTTextAlignment, lineBreakMode: CTLineBreakMode) -> MeshResource
Generates a 3D mesh for rendering static text.
static func generateText(String, extrusionDepth: Float, font: MeshResource.Font, containerFrame: CGRect, alignment: CTTextAlignment, lineBreakMode: CTLineBreakMode) -> MeshResource
Generates a 3D mesh for rendering static text.
