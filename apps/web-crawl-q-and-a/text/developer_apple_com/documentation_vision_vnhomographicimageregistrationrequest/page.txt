Class
VNHomographicImageRegistrationRequest
An image analysis request that determines the perspective warp matrix necessary to align the content of two images.

class VNHomographicImageRegistrationRequest : VNImageRegistrationRequest
Overview
Create and perform a homographic image registration request to align content in two images through a homography. A homography is an isomorphism of projected spaces, a bijection that maps lines to lines.
Topics
Accessing the Results
var results: [VNImageHomographicAlignmentObservation]?
The results of the image registration request.
Identifying Request Revisions
let VNHomographicImageRegistrationRequestRevision1: Int
A constant for specifying revision 1 of the homographic image registration request.
