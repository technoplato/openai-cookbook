var shouldLoop: Bool { get set }
Discussion
Set this value to true to tell the associated AudioPlaybackController instance to loop playback indefinitely. You typically do this with resources prepared specifically to loop from the end back to the beginning without audible interruptions (seamless loops). This lets you create ambient sound that never ends, for example.
