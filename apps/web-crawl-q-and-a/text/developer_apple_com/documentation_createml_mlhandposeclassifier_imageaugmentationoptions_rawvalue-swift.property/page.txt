Instance Property
rawValue
The corresponding value of the raw type.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
let rawValue: Int
Discussion
A new instance initialized with rawValue will be equivalent to this instance. For example:
enum PaperSize: String {
    case A4, A5, Letter, Legal
}


let selectedSize = PaperSize.Letter
print(selectedSize.rawValue)
// Prints "Letter"


print(selectedSize == PaperSize(rawValue: selectedSize.rawValue)!)
// Prints "true"
