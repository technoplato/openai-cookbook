var maximumIterations: Int
Discussion
More iterations will produce better models as long as there is no over-fitting. Over-fitting happens when the dropout probability is too low or there is not enough training data.
Note
This parameter is only used by the fitted method. When using the update method it’s up to you to decide when to stop.
