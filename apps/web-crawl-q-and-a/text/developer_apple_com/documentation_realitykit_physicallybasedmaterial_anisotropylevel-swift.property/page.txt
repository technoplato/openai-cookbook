var anisotropyLevel: PhysicallyBasedMaterial.AnisotropyLevel { get set }
Discussion
By default, PBR materials are isotropic; in other words, an entity that uses PhysicallyBasedMaterial reflects light uniformly in all directions, mimicking the behavior of most real-world objects. Some objects, including those with many small parallel striations such as vinyl records, CDs, or straight hair, reflect light more in some directions than others, resulting in stretched or oblong specular highlights, as shown in the following figure.
This property controls the amount of anisotropy. It works together with anisotropyAngle, which defines the angle of elongation for the specular highlights.
The following example specifies anisotropyLevel using single values for the entire material:
material.anisotropyLevel = .AnisotropyLevel(floatLiteral: 0.5)
This example specifies anisotropyLevel using a UV-mapped image texture.
if let anisoLevelResource = try? TextureResource.load(named:
"entity_aniso_level") {
    let anisoLevelMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(sheenResource)
    material.anisotropyLevel = .init(texture: anisoLevelMap)
}
