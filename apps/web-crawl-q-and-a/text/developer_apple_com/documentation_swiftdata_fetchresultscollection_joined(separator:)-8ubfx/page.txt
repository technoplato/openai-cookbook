func joined<Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence<Self> where Separator : Sequence, Separator.Element == Self.Element.Element
Parameters
separator
A sequence to insert between each of this sequence’s elements.
Return Value
The joined sequence of elements.
Discussion
This example shows how an array of [Int] instances can be joined, using another [Int] instance as the separator:
let nestedNumbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
let joined = nestedNumbers.joined(separator: [-1, -2])
print(Array(joined))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, -1, -2, 4, 5, 6, -1, -2, 7, 8, 9]"
