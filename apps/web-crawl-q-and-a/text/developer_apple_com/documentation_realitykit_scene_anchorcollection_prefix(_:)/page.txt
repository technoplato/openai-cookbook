Instance Method
prefix(_:)
Returns a subsequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the collection.
RealityKit
Swift
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func prefix(_ maxLength: Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Parameters
maxLength
The maximum number of elements to return. maxLength must be greater than or equal to zero.
Return Value
A subsequence starting at the beginning of this collection with at most maxLength elements.
Overview
If the maximum length exceeds the number of elements in the collection, the result contains all the elements in the collection.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers.prefix(2))
// Prints "[1, 2]"
print(numbers.prefix(10))
// Prints "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(k), where k is the number of elements to select from the beginning of the collection.

func prefix(while: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.SubSequence

func suffix(Int) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence, up to the given maximum length, containing the final elements of the collection.
func suffix(from: Self.Index) -> Self.SubSequence
Returns a subsequence from the specified position to the end of the collection.
func randomElement() -> Self.Element?
Returns a random element of the collection.
func randomElement<T>(using: inout T) -> Self.Element?
