Discussion
Any modifiers applied to the content of body will be applied to this view, and the changes to the transaction performed in the transform will only affect the modifiers defined in the body.
The following code animates the opacity changing with a faster animation, while the contents of MyView are animated with the implicit transaction:
MyView(isActive: isActive)
    .transaction { transaction in
        transaction.animation = transaction.animation?.speed(2)
    } body: { content in
        content.opacity(isActive ? 1.0 : 0.0)
    }
