func toolbarBackground(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    for bars: ToolbarPlacement...
) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The preferred visibility of the background of the bar.
bars
The bars to update the color scheme of or ToolbarPlacement/automatic if empty.
Discussion
The preferred visibility flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS.
In iOS, a value of ToolbarPlacement/automatic makes the visibility of a tab bar or navigation bar background depend on where a List or ScrollView settles. For example, when aligned to the bottom edge of of a scroll view’s content, the background of a tab bar becomes transparent.
Specify a value of Visibility/visible to ensure that the background of a bar remains visible regardless of where any scroll view or list stops scrolling.
This example shows a view that prefers to always have the tab bar visible when the middle tab is selected:
TabView {
    FirstTab()
    MiddleTab()
        .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .tabBar)
    LastTab()
}
You can provide multiple placements to customize multiple bars at once, as in the following example:
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbarBackground(
                .visible, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
