Instance Method
phaseAnimator(_:content:animation:)
Cycles through the given phases continuously, updating the content using the view builder closure that you supply.

func phaseAnimator<Phase>(
    _ phases: some Sequence,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (PlaceholderContentView<Self>, Phase) -> some View,
    animation: @escaping (Phase) -> Animation? = { _ in .default }
) -> some View where Phase : Equatable
Parameters
phases
Phases defining the states that will be cycled through. This sequence must not be empty. If an empty sequence is provided, a visual warning will be displayed in place of this view, and a warning will be logged.
content
A view builder closure that takes two parameters. The first parameter is a proxy value representing the modified view. The second parameter is the current phase.
animation
A closure that returns the animation to use when transitioning to the next phase. If nil is returned, the transition will not be animated.
Discussion
The phases that you provide define the individual values that will be animated between.
When the view first appears, the the first phase is provided to the content closure. The animator then immediately animates to the second phase, using an animation returned from the animation closure. This continues until the last phase is reached, after which the animator loops back to the beginning.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
