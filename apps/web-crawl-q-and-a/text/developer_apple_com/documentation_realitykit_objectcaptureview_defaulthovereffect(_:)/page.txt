func defaultHoverEffect(_ effect: HoverEffect?) -> some View
Parameters
effect
The default hover effect to use for views within this view.
Return Value
A view that uses this effect as the default hover effect.
Discussion
Use this modifier to set a specific hover effect for all views with the View/hoverEffect(_:) modifier applied within a view. The default effect is typically used when no HoverEffect was provided or if HoverEffect/automatic is specified.
For example, this view uses HoverEffect/highlight for both the red and green Color views:
HStack {
    Color.red.hoverEffect()
    Color.green.hoverEffect()
}
.defaultHoverEffect(.highlight)
This also works for customizing the default hover effect in views like Buttons when using a SwiftUI-defined style like ButtonStyle/bordered, which can provide a hover effect by default. For example, this view replaces the hover effect for a Button with HoverEffect/highlight:
Button("Next") {}
    // perform action
}
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
.defaultHoverEffect(.highlight)
Use a nil effect to indicate that the default hover effect should not be modified.
