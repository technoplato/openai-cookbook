    action: @escaping (KeyPress) -> KeyPress.Result
) -> some View
Parameters
key
The key to match against incoming hardware keyboard events.
phases
The key-press phases to match (.down, .up, and .repeat).
action
The action to perform. The action receives a value describing the matched key event. Return .handled to consume the event and prevent further dispatch, or .ignored to allow dispatch to continue.
Return Value
A modified view that binds hardware keyboard input when focused.
Discussion
SwiftUI performs the action for the specified event phases.
