Discussion
To check whether a collection is empty, use its isEmpty property instead of comparing count to zero. Unless the collection guarantees random-access performance, calculating count can be an O(n) operation.
Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to RandomAccessCollection; otherwise, O(n), where n is the length of the collection.

var isScalar: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether the shaped array slice has zero dimensions.
let shape: [Int]
An integer array in which each element represents the size of the corresponding dimension.
var strides: [Int]
An integer array in which each element is the number of memory locations that spans the length of the corresponding dimension.
var isEmpty: Bool
A Boolean value indicating whether the collection is empty.
var scalarCount: Int
The total number of elements in the shaped array slice.
var underestimatedCount: Int
A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the collection.
