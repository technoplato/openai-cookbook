var l2Penalty: Double
Discussion
The larger this weight, the more the model coefficients shrink toward 0. This introduces bias into the model but decreases variance, potentially leading to better predictions. The default is 0.01.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
