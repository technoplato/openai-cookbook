Discussion
In physically based rendering (PBR), specular highlights primarily come from the object’s roughness value. RealityKit renders materials that have a low roughness value with specular highlights based on the environment, lighting, and shape of the entity. As a result, for most materials, you don’t need to specify a specular value.
For some types of dielectric (nonmetallic) materials, like facet-cut glass or gems, PBR algorithms don’t create bright enough specular highlights using just roughness. To accurately simulate those types of materials, the specular property allows you to specify additional specularity for the entity.
The following example demonstrates how to add specularity using a single value for the entire material:
material.specular = .init(floatLiteral: 0.8)
The following code shows how to add specularity using a UV-mapped image texture:
if let specularResource = try? TextureResource.load(named: "entity_specular") {
    let specularMap = MaterialParameters.Texture(specularResource)
    material.specular = .init(texture: specularMap)
}
With custom materials, the specular scale and texture are available to the material’s shader functions, but RealityKit doesn’t automatically use the values you set. To render a custom material with additional specular highlights, the material’s lightingModel must be CustomMaterial.LightingModel.lit or CustomMaterial.LightingModel.clearcoat and the material’s surface shader must call params().surface().set_specular().
The following Metal code demonstrates using the specular scale and texture values, simulating the behavior of the shaders that render a PhysicallyBasedMaterial:
    // Retrieve the opacity scale from the CustomMaterial.
    float specularScale = params.material_constants().specular_scale();


    // Retrieve the entity's texture coordinates.
    float2 uv = params.geometry().uv0();


    // Entities loaded from a USDZ or .reality file use texture coordinates
    // with a flipped y-axis. This compensates for that.
    uv.y = 1.0 - uv.y;


    // Sample the specular texture.
    auto tex = params.textures();
    half specular = tex.specular().sample(textureSampler, uv).r;


    // Multiply the tint and the sampled value from the texture and assign
    // the result.
    specular *= specularScale;
    params.surface().set_specular(specular);
