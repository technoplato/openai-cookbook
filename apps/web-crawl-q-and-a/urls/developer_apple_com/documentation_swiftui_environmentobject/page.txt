@frozen @propertyWrapper
struct EnvironmentObject<ObjectType> where ObjectType : ObservableObject
Overview
An environment object invalidates the current view whenever the observable object that conforms to ObservableObject changes. If you declare a property as an environment object, be sure to set a corresponding model object on an ancestor view by calling its environmentObject(_:) modifier.
Note
If your observable object conforms to the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocol, use Environment instead of EnvironmentObject and set the model object in an ancestor view by calling its environment(_:) or environment(_:_:) modifiers.
