Instance Method
edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:)
Changes the view’s proposed area to extend outside the screen’s safe areas.
iOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
iPadOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
Mac Catalyst 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
tvOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
watchOS 6.0–10.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0–1.0 Deprecated
func edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_ edges: Edge.Set) -> some View
Deprecated
Use ignoresSafeArea(_:edges:) instead.
Parameters
edges
The set of the edges in which to expand the size requested for this view.
Return Value
A view that may extend outside of the screen’s safe area on the edges specified by edges.
Discussion
Use edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) to change the area proposed for this view so that — were the proposal accepted — this view could extend outside the safe area to the bounds of the screen for the specified edges.
For example, you can propose that a text view ignore the safe area’s top inset:
VStack {
    Text("This text is outside of the top safe area.")
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea([.top])
        .border(Color.purple)
    Text("This text is inside VStack.")
        .border(Color.yellow)
}
.border(Color.gray)
Depending on the surrounding view hierarchy, SwiftUI may not honor an edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) request. This can happen, for example, if the view is inside a container that respects the screen’s safe area. In that case you may need to apply edgesIgnoringSafeArea(_:) to the container instead.

Layout modifiers
func frame() -> some View
Positions this view within an invisible frame.
Deprecated
func coordinateSpace<T>(name: T) -> some View
Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.
Deprecated
