@MainActor
final func render(
    rasterizationScale: CGFloat = 1,
    renderer: (CGSize, (CGContext) -> Void) -> Void
)
Parameters
rasterizationScale
The scale factor for converting user interface points to pixels when rasterizing parts of the view that can’t be represented as native Core Graphics drawing commands.
renderer
The closure that sets up the Core Graphics context and renders the view. This closure receives two parameters: the size of the view and a function that you invoke in the closure to render the view at the reported size. This function takes a CGContext parameter, and assumes a bottom-left coordinate space origin.
Discussion
Use this method to rasterize the renderer’s content to a CGContext you provide. The renderer closure receives two parameters: the current size of the view, and a function that renders the view to your CGContext. Implement the closure to provide a suitable CGContext, then invoke the function to render the content to that context.
