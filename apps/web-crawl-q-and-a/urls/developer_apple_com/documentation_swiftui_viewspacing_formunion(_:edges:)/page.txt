Instance Method

mutating func formUnion(
    _ other: ViewSpacing,
    edges: Edge.Set = .all
)
Parameters
other
Another spacing preferences instances to merge with this one.
edges
The edges to merge. Edges that you don’t specify are unchanged after the method completes.
Discussion
When you merge another spacing preference instance with this one, this instance ends up with the greater of its original value or the other instance’s value for each of the specified edges. You can call the method repeatedly with each value in a collection to merge a collection of preferences. The result has the smallest preferences on each edge that meets the largest requirements of all the inputs for that edge.
If you want to merge preferences without modifying the original instance, use union(_:edges:) instead.
