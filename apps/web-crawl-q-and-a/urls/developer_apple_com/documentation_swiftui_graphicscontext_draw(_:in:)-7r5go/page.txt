func draw(
    _ symbol: GraphicsContext.ResolvedSymbol,
    in rect: CGRect
)
Parameters
symbol
The GraphicsContext.ResolvedSymbol to draw. Get a resolved symbol by calling resolveSymbol(id:) with the identifier that you use to tag the corresponding child view during Canvas initialization.
rect
The rectangle in the current user space to draw the symbol in.
Discussion
The current context state defines the full drawing operation. For example, the current transformation and clip shapes affect how SwiftUI draws the symbol.

A static sequence of drawing operations that may be drawn multiple times, preserving their resolution independence.
