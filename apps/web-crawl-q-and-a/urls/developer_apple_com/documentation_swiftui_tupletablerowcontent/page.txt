struct TupleTableRowContent<Value, T> where Value : Identifiable
Overview
Don’t use this type directly; instead, SwiftUI uses this type as the return value from the various buildBlock methods in TableRowBuilder. The size of the tuple corresponds to how many columns you create in the rows closure you provide to the Table initializer.
