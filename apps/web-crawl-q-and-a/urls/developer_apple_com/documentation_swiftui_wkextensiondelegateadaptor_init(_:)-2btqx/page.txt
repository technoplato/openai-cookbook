Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a WatchKit extension delegate adaptor using a delegate that’s an observable object.
watchOS 7.0+
@MainActor
init(_ delegateType: DelegateType.Type = DelegateType.self)
Available when DelegateType inherits NSObject, DelegateType conforms to ObservableObject, and DelegateType conforms to WKExtensionDelegate.
Parameters
delegateType
The type of extension delegate that you define in your app, which conforms to the WKExtensionDelegate and ObservableObject protocols.
Discussion
Call this initializer indirectly by creating a property with the WKExtensionDelegateAdaptor property wrapper from inside your App declaration:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @WKExtensionDelegateAdaptor private var extensionDelegate: MyExtensionDelegate


    var body: some Scene { ... }
}
SwiftUI initializes the delegate and manages its lifetime, calling it as needed to handle extension delegate callbacks.
SwiftUI invokes this method when your extension delegate conforms to the ObservableObject protocol. In this case, SwiftUI automatically places the delegate in the Environment. You can access such a delegate from any scene or view in your app using the EnvironmentObject property wrapper:
@EnvironmentObject private var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate
If your delegate isn’t an observable object, SwiftUI invokes the init(_:) initializer rather than this one, and doesn’t put the delegate instance in the environment.
