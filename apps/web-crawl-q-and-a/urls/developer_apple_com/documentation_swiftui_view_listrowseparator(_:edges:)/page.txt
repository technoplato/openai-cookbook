func listRowSeparator(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    edges: VerticalEdge.Set = .all
) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The visibility of this row’s separators.
edges
The set of row edges for which this preference applies. The list style might already decide to not display separators for some edges, typically the top edge. The default is all.
Discussion
Separators can be presented above and below a row. You can specify to which edge this preference should apply.
This modifier expresses a preference to the containing List. The list style is the final arbiter of the separator visibility.
The following example shows a simple grouped list whose row separators are hidden:
List {
    ForEach(garage.cars) { car in
        Text(car.model)
            .listRowSeparator(.hidden)
    }
}
.listStyle(.grouped)
To change the color of a row separators, use listRowSeparatorTint(_:edges:). To hide or change the tint color for a section separators, use listSectionSeparator(_:edges:) and listSectionSeparatorTint(_:edges:).
