func toolbarBackground(
    _ visibility: Visibility,
    for bars: ToolbarPlacement...
) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The preferred visibility of the background of the bar.
bars
The bars to update the color scheme of or automatic if empty.
Discussion
The preferred visibility flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS.
In iOS, a value of automatic makes the visibility of a tab bar or navigation bar background depend on where a List or ScrollView settles. For example, when aligned to the bottom edge of of a scroll view’s content, the background of a tab bar becomes transparent.
Specify a value of Visibility.visible to ensure that the background of a bar remains visible regardless of where any scroll view or list stops scrolling.
This example shows a view that prefers to always have the tab bar visible when the middle tab is selected:
TabView {
    FirstTab()
    MiddleTab()
        .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .tabBar)
    LastTab()
}
You can provide multiple placements to customize multiple bars at once, as in the following example:
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbarBackground(
                .visible, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
