Parameters
content
A ViewBuilder that contains the views to lay out.
Return Value
A composite view that combines all the input views.
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you instantiate a custom layout that conforms to the Layout protocol:
BasicVStack { // Implicitly calls callAsFunction.
    Text("A View")
    Text("Another View")
}
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
