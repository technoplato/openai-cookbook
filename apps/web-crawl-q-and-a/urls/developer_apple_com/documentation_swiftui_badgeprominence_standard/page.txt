Discussion
This level of prominence should be used for badges that display a value that suggests user action, such as a count of unread messages or new invitations.
In lists on macOS, this results in a badge label on a grayscale platter; and in lists on iOS, this prominence of badge has no platter.

    Text(mailbox.name)
        .badge(mailbox.numberOfUnreadMessages)
}
