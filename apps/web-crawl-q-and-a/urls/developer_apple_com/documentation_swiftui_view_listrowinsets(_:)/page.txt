func listRowInsets(_ insets: EdgeInsets?) -> some View
Parameters
insets
The EdgeInsets to apply to the edges of the view.
Return Value
A view that uses the given edge insets when used as a list cell.
Discussion
Use listRowInsets(_:) to change the default padding of the content of list items.
In the example below, the Flavor enumeration provides content for list items. The SwiftUI ForEach structure computes views for each element of the Flavor enumeration and extracts the raw value of each of its elements using the resulting text to create each list row item. The listRowInsets(_:) modifier then changes the edge insets of each row of the list according to the EdgeInsets provided:
struct ContentView: View {
    enum Flavor: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
        var id: String { self.rawValue }
        case vanilla, chocolate, strawberry
    }


    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(Flavor.allCases) {
                Text($0.rawValue)
                    .listRowInsets(.init(top: 0,
                                         leading: 25,
                                         bottom: 0,
                                         trailing: 0))
            }
        }
    }
}
