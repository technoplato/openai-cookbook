func navigationDestination<D, C>(
    for data: D.Type,
    @ViewBuilder destination: @escaping (D) -> C
) -> some View where D : Hashable, C : View
Parameters
data
The type of data that this destination matches.
destination
A view builder that defines a view to display when the stack’s navigation state contains a value of type data. The closure takes one argument, which is the value of the data to present.
Discussion
Add this view modifer to a view inside a NavigationStack to describe the view that the stack displays when presenting a particular kind of data. Use a NavigationLink to present the data. For example, you can present a ColorDetail view for each presentation of a Color instance:
NavigationStack {
    List {
        NavigationLink("Mint", value: Color.mint)
        NavigationLink("Pink", value: Color.pink)
        NavigationLink("Teal", value: Color.teal)
    }
    .navigationDestination(for: Color.self) { color in
        ColorDetail(color: color)
    }
    .navigationTitle("Colors")
}
You can add more than one navigation destination modifier to the stack if it needs to present more than one kind of data.
Do not put a navigation destination modifier inside a “lazy” container, like List or LazyVStack. These containers create child views only when needed to render on screen. Add the navigation destination modifier outside these containers so that the navigation stack can always see the destination.

Associates a destination view with a binding that can be used to push the view onto a NavigationStack.
func navigationDestination<D, C>(item: Binding<Optional<D>>, destination: (D) -> C) -> some View
