Discussion
Use confirmation actions to receive user confirmation of a particular action. An example of a confirmation action would be an action with the label “Add” to add a new event to the calendar.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places confirmationAction items on the trailing edge in the trailing-most position of the sheet and gain the apps accent color as a background color.
In iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, the system places confirmationAction items in the same location as a primaryAction placement.
In watchOS, the system places confirmationAction items in the trailing edge of the navigation bar.
