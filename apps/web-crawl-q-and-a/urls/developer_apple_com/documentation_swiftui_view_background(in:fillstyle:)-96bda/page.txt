Instance Method
background(in:fillStyle:)
Sets the view’s background to a shape filled with the default background style.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func background<S>(
    in shape: S,
    fillStyle: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : Shape
Parameters
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to Shape that SwiftUI draws behind the view using the background shape style.
fillStyle
The FillStyle to use when drawing the shape. The default style uses the nonzero winding number rule and antialiasing.
Return Value
A view with the specified shape drawn behind it.
Discussion
This modifier behaves like background(_:in:fillStyle:), except that it always uses the background shape style to fill the specified shape. For example, you can create a Path that outlines a trapezoid:
let trapezoid = Path { path in
    path.move(to: .zero)
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 90, y: 0))
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 80, y: 50))
    path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 10, y: 50))
}
Then you can use that shape as a background for a Label:
ZStack {
    Color.teal
    Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
        .padding()
        .background(in: trapezoid)
}
Without the background modifier, the fill color shows through the label. With the modifier, the label’s text and icon appear backed by a shape filled with a color that’s appropriate for light or dark appearance:
To create a background with other View types — or with a stack of views — use background(alignment:content:) instead. To add a ShapeStyle as a background, use background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:).
