static func colorShader(_ shader: Shader) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply to self as a color filter.
Return Value
A filter that applies the shader as a color filter.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a color filter it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position, half4 color, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the pixel applied to the shader and color its source color, as a pre-multiplied color in the destination color space. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader. The function should return the modified color value.
