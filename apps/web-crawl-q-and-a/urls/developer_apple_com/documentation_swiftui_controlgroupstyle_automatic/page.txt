Discussion
The default control group style can vary by platform. By default, both platforms use a momentary segmented control style that’s appropriate for the environment in which it is rendered.
You can override a control group’s style. To apply the default style to a control group or to a view that contains a control group, use the controlGroupStyle(_:) modifier.
