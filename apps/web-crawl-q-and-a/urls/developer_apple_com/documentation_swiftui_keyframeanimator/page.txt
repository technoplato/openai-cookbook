struct KeyframeAnimator<Value, KeyframePath, Content> where Value == KeyframePath.Value, KeyframePath : Keyframes, Content : View
Overview
The content closure updates every frame while animating, so avoid performing any expensive operations directly within content.

Creating a phase animator
init(initialValue: Value, repeating: Bool, content: (Value) -> Content, keyframes: (Value) -> KeyframePath)
Loops the given keyframes continuously, updating the view using the modifiers you apply in body.
init(initialValue: Value, trigger: some Equatable, content: (Value) -> Content, keyframes: (Value) -> KeyframePath)
Plays the given keyframes when the given trigger value changes, updating the view using the modifiers you apply in body.
