Discussion
This ViewSpacing instance indicates how much space a subview in a custom layout prefers to have between it and the next view. It contains preferences for all edges, and might take into account the type of both this and the adjacent view. If your Layout type places subviews based on spacing preferences, use this instance to compute a distance between this subview and the next. See placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:) for an example.
You can also merge this instance with instances from other subviews to construct a new instance that’s suitable for the subviews’ container. See spacing(subviews:cache:).
