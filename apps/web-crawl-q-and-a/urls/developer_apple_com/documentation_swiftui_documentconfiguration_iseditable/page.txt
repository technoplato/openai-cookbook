Discussion
On macOS, the document could be non-editable if the user lacks write permissions, the parent directory or volume is read-only, or the document couldn’t be autosaved.
On iOS, the document is not editable if there was an error reading or saving it, there’s an unresolved conflict, the document is being uploaded or downloaded, or otherwise, it is currently busy and unsafe for user edits.
