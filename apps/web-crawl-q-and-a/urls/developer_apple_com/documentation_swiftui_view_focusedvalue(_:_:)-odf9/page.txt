Instance Method
focusedValue(_:_:)
Creates a new view that exposes the provided value to other views whose state depends on the focused view hierarchy.

func focusedValue<Value>(
    _ keyPath: WritableKeyPath<FocusedValues, Value?>,
    _ value: Value?
) -> some View
Parameters
keyPath
The key path to associate value with when adding it to the existing table of exported focus values.
value
The focus value to export, or nil if no value is currently available.
Return Value
A modified representation of this view.
Discussion
Use this method instead of View/focusedSceneValue(_:_:) when your scene includes multiple focusable views with their own associated values, and you need an app- or scene-scoped element like a command or toolbar item that operates on the value associated with whichever view currently has focus. Each focusable view can supply its own value:
