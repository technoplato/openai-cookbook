Instance Method
exportableToServices(_:onEdit:)
Exports read-write items for consumption by shortcuts, quick actions, and services.
macOS 13.0+
func exportableToServices<T>(
    _ payload: @autoclosure @escaping () -> [T],
    onEdit: @escaping ([T]) -> Bool
) -> some View where T : Transferable
Parameters
payload
A closure that will be called on request of the items by the shortcut or service.
onEdit
A closure that will be called after the shortcut or service completes with its output data. This should replace the selected subpart that was exported with onExport. Return false to indicate that there was a failure to receive the items.
Discussion
If the associated view supports selection, the exported item should reflect that selected subpart.
@State private var title: String
var body: some View {
    Color.pink
        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
        .exportableToServices([title]) { editedTitles
            title = editedTitles.first ?? title
            return !editedTitles.isEmpty
        }
}
