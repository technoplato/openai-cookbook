var documentConfiguration: DocumentConfiguration? { get }
Discussion
The value is nil for views that are not enclosed in a DocumentGroup.
For example, if the app shows the document path in the footer of each document, it can get the URL from the environment:
struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var document: TextDocument
    @Environment(\.documentConfiguration) private var configuration: DocumentConfiguration?


    var body: some View {
        …
        Label(
            configuration?.fileURL?.path ??
                "", systemImage: "folder.circle"
        )
    }
}
