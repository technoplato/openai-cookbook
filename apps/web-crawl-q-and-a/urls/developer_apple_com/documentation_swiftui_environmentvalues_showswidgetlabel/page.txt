Instance Property
showsWidgetLabel
A Boolean value that indicates whether an accessory family widget can display an accessory label.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var showsWidgetLabel: Bool { get set }
Discussion
Use this value to determine if you can provide additional content, or possibly move some of the widget’s content out of the main view and into the widget label.
@Environment(\.widgetFamily) var widgetFamily
@Environment(\.showsWidgetLabel) var showsWidgetLabel


var body: some View {
   switch widgetFamily {
   case .accessoryCircular:
       if showsWidgetLabel {
           Image("cat_full")
               .widgetLabel(label: Text("Cats"))
       }
       else {
           VStack {
               Image("cat_small")
               Text("Cats")
           }
       }
   }
}
This environment value is most useful when defining the appearance for the WidgetKit/WidgetFamily/accessoryCircular widget family, because it’s value can change depending on where the widget appears. For example, if the widget is the top circular complication on the Infograph watch face, the value is true. Otherwise it is false. The environment variable is always false in iOS.
Other families always have the same value, regardless of where the widget appears. For the WidgetKit/WidgetFamily/accessoryCorner widget family, the value is always true. For other families, it is false.
