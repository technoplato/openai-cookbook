Structure
SpatialEventGesture
A gesture that activates immediately upon receiving any spatial event that describes clicks, touches, or pinches.

struct SpatialEventGesture
Overview
Use the action closure to handle the collection of events that target this gesture’s view. The phase of the events in the collection may move to ended or cancelled while the gesture itself remains active. Individually track state for each Event inside the action closure. The following shows a SpatialEventGesture that emits particles in a simulation:
struct ParticlePlayground: View {
    @StateObject
    var model = ParticlesModel()
    var body: some View {
        Canvas { context, size in
            for p in model.particles {
                drawParticle(p, in: context)
            }
        }.gesture(SpatialEventGesture { events in
            for event in events {
                if event.phase == .active {
                    // Update a particle emitter at each active event's location.
                    model.emitters[event.id] = ParticlesModel.Emitter(
                        location: event.location
                    )
                } else {
                    // Clear out emitter state when the event is no longer active.
                    model.emitters[event.id] = nil
                }
            }
        })
    }
}
Topics
Creating a spatial event gesture
init(coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpaceProtocol, action: (SpatialEventCollection) -> Void)
Creates the gesture with a desired coordinate space and a handler that triggers when any event state changes.
Getting gesture properties
let action: (SpatialEventCollection) -> Void
The action to call when the state of any event changes.
let coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace
The coordinate space of the gesture.
var internalBody: some Gesture<()>
