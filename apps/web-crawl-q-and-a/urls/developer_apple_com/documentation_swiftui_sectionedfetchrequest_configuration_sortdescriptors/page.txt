var sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor<Result>] { get set }
Available when SectionIdentifier conforms to Hashable and Result inherits NSManagedObject.
Discussion
Set this configuration value to cause a SectionedFetchRequest to execute a fetch with a new collection of SortDescriptor instances. If you want to use NSSortDescriptor instances, set nsSortDescriptors instead. Use care to coordinate section and sort updates, as described in SectionedFetchRequest.Configuration.
Access this value for a given request by using the sortDescriptors property on the associated SectionedFetchResults instance, either directly or with a Binding.
