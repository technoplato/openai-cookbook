Initializer
init(value:in:step:format:label:onEditingChanged:)
Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<F>(
    value: Binding<F.FormatInput>,
    in bounds: ClosedRange<F.FormatInput>,
    step: F.FormatInput.Stride = 1,
    format: F,
    @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label,
    onEditingChanged: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
) where F : ParseableFormatStyle, F.FormatInput : BinaryFloatingPoint, F.FormatOutput == String
Available when Label conforms to View.
Parameters
value
A Binding to a value that you provide.
bounds
A closed range that describes the upper and lower bounds permitted by the stepper.
step
The amount to increment or decrement the stepper when the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons, respectively.
format
A format style of type F to use when converting between the string the user edits and the underlying value of type F.FormatInput. If format can’t perform the conversion, the stepper leaves value unchanged. If the user stops editing the text in an invalid state, the stepper updates the text to the last known valid value.
label
A view describing the purpose of this stepper.
onEditingChanged
A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a stepper which causes the execution of the onEditingChanged closure at the start and end of the gesture.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create a stepper that increments or decrements a binding to value by the step size you provide within the given bounds. By setting the bounds, you ensure that the value never goes below or above the lowest or highest value, respectively.
The example below shows a stepper that displays the effect of incrementing or decrementing a value with the step size of step with the bounds defined by range:
struct StepperView: View {
    @State private var value = 0
    let step = 5
    let range = 1...50


    var body: some View {
        Stepper(value: $value,
                in: range,
                step: step,
                format: .number) {
            Text("Current: \(value) in \(range.description) " +
                 "stepping by \(step)")
        }
            .padding(10)
    }
}
