init(
    _ data: Range<Int>,

)
Available when Data is Range<Int>, ID is Int, and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
data
A constant range.
content
The view builder that creates views dynamically.
Discussion
The instance only reads the initial value of the provided data and doesn’t need to identify views across updates. To compute views on demand over a dynamic range, use ForEach/init(_:id:content:).
