Initializer
init(supportedTypes:payloadAction:)
Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard.
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
@MainActor
init(
    supportedTypes: [String],
    payloadAction: @escaping ([NSItemProvider]) -> Void
)
Deprecated
Use the init(supportedContentTypes:payloadAction:) initializer instead.
Parameters
supportedTypes
The exact uniform type identifiers supported by the button. If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the button becomes disabled.
payloadAction
The handler to call when the user clicks the Paste button, and the pasteboard has items that conform to supportedTypes. This closure receives an array of item providers that you use to inspect and load the pasteboard data.
Discussion
Set the contents of supportedTypes in order of your app’s preference for its supported types. The Paste button takes the most-preferred type that the pasteboard source supports and delivers this to the payloadAction closure.
