Overview
To support multiple types of widgets, add the @main attribute to a structure that conforms to WidgetBundle. For example, a game might have one widget to display summary information about the game and a second widget to display detailed information about individual characters.
@main
struct GameWidgets: WidgetBundle {
   var body: some Widget {
       GameStatusWidget()
       CharacterDetailWidget()
   }
}
