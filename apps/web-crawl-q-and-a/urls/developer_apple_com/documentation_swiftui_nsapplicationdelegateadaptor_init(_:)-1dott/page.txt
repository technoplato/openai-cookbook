Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates an AppKit app delegate adaptor using a delegate that’s an observable object.
macOS 11.0+
@MainActor
init(_ delegateType: DelegateType.Type = DelegateType.self)
Available when DelegateType inherits NSObject, DelegateType conforms to NSApplicationDelegate, and DelegateType conforms to ObservableObject.
Parameters
delegateType
The type of application delegate that you define in your app, which conforms to the NSApplicationDelegate and ObservableObject protocols.
Discussion
Call this initializer indirectly by creating a property with the NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor property wrapper from inside your App declaration:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor private var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate


    var body: some Scene { ... }
}
SwiftUI initializes the delegate and manages its lifetime, calling it as needed to handle application delegate callbacks.
SwiftUI invokes this method when your app delegate conforms to the ObservableObject protocol. In this case, SwiftUI automatically places the delegate in the Environment. You can access such a delegate from any scene or view in your app using the EnvironmentObject property wrapper:
@EnvironmentObject private var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate
If your delegate isn’t an observable object, SwiftUI invokes the init(_:) initializer rather than this one, and doesn’t put the delegate instance in the environment.
