Discussion
Use this modifier to hide or show scroll indicators on scrollable content in views like a ScrollView, List, or TextEditor. This modifier applies the prefered visibility to any scrollable content within a view hierarchy.
ScrollView {
    VStack(alignment: .leading) {
        ForEach(0..<100) {
            Text("Row \($0)")
        }
    }
}
.scrollIndicators(.hidden)
Use the hidden value to indicate that you prefer that views never show scroll indicators along a given axis. Use visible when you prefer that views show scroll indicators. Depending on platform conventions, visible scroll indicators might only appear while scrolling. Pass automatic to allow views to decide whether or not to show their indicators.
