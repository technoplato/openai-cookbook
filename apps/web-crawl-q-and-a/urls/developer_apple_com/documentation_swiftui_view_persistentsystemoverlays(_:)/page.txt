func persistentSystemOverlays(_ visibility: Visibility) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
A value that indicates the visibility of the non-transient system views overlaying the app.
Discussion
Use this modifier if you would like to customise the immersive experience of your app by hiding or showing system overlays that may affect user experience. The following example hides every persistent system overlay.
struct ImmersiveView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Maximum immersion")
            .persistentSystemOverlays(.hidden)
    }
}
Note that this modifier only sets a preference and, ultimately the system will decide if it will honour it or not.
These non-transient system views include:
The Home indicator
The SharePlay indicator
The Multi-task indicator and Picture-in-picture on iPad
