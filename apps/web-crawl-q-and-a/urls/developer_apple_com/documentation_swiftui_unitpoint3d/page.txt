Structure
UnitPoint3D
A normalized 3D point in a view’s coordinate space.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta

struct UnitPoint3D
Overview
Use a 3D unit point to represent a three-dimensional location in a view without having to know the view’s rendered size. The point stores a value in each dimension that indicates the fraction of the view’s size in that dimension — measured from the view’s origin — where the point appears. For example, you can create a unit point that represents the center of any view by using the value 0.5 for each dimension:
let unitPoint = UnitPoint3D(x: 0.5, y: 0.5, z: 0.5)
Note
If you need a two-dimensional unit point, use UnitPoint instead.
To project the unit point into the rendered view’s coordinate space, multiply each component of the unit point with the corresponding component of the view’s size:
let projectedPoint = Point3D(
    x: unitPoint.x * size.width,
    y: unitPoint.y * size.height,
    z: unitPoint.z * size.depth
)
You can perform this calculation yourself if you happen to know a view’s size, or if you want to use a unit point for some custom purpose, but SwiftUI typically does this for you to carry out operations that you request, like when you rotate a view with the rotation3DEffect(_:anchor:) modifier and indicate the anchor point that you want to rotate the view around.
You can create custom unit points with explicit values, like the example above, or you can use one of the built-in unit points that SwiftUI provides, like zero, center, or topTrailing. The built-in values correspond to common anchor points that you might want to refer to, like the center of one of a view’s edges.
Note
A unit point with one or more components outside the range [0, 1] projects to a point outside of the view.
Layout direction
When a person configures their device to use a left-to-right language like English, the system places the view’s origin in its top-left-back corner, with positive x toward the right, positive y toward the bottom of the view, and positive z toward the front. In a right-to-left environment, the origin moves to the upper-right-back corner, and the positive x direction changes to be toward the left. You don’t typically need to do anything to handle this change, because SwiftUI applies the change to all aspects of the system. For example, see the discussion about layout direction in HorizontalAlignment.
It’s important to test your app for the different locales that you distribute your app in. For more information about the localization process, see Localization.
