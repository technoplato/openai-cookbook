func modelContainer(_ container: ModelContainer) -> some Scene
Parameters
container
The model container to use for this scene.
Discussion
In this example, RecipesApp sets a shared model container to use for all of its windows:
@main
struct RecipesApp: App {
    @State private var container = ModelContainer(...)


    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            RecipesList()
        }
        .modelContainer(container)
    }
}
The environment’s modelContext property will be assigned a new context associated with this container. All implicit model context operations in this scene, such as Query properties, will use the environment’s context.
