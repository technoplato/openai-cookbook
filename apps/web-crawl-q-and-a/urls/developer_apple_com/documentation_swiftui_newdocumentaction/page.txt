Structure
NewDocumentAction
An action that presents a new document.
macOS 13.0+
struct NewDocumentAction
Overview
Use the newDocument environment value to get the instance of this structure for a given Environment. Then call the instance to present a new document. You call the instance directly because it defines a callAsFunction(_:) method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can define a button that creates a new document from the selected text:
struct NewDocumentFromSelection: View {
    @FocusedBinding(\.selectedText) private var selectedText: String?
    @Environment(\.newDocument) private var newDocument


    var body: some View {
        Button("New Document With Selection") {
            newDocument(TextDocument(text: selectedText))
        }
        .disabled(selectedText?.isEmpty != false)
    }
}
The above example assumes that you define a TextDocument that conforms to the FileDocument or ReferenceFileDocument protocol, and a DocumentGroup that handles the associated file type.
