var inverse: UnitCurve { get }
Discussion
The inverse can be used to solve a curve in reverse: given a known output (y) value, the corresponding input (x) value can be found by using inverse:
let curve = UnitCurve.easeInOut


/// The input time for which an easeInOut curve returns 0.6.
let inputTime = curve.inverse.evaluate(at: 0.6)
