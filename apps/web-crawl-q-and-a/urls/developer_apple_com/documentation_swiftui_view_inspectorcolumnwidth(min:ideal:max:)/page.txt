func inspectorColumnWidth(
    min: CGFloat? = nil,
    ideal: CGFloat,
    max: CGFloat? = nil
) -> some View
Parameters
min
The minimum allowed width for the trailing column inspector
ideal
The initial width of the inspector in the absence of state restoration. ideal influences the resulting width on macOS when a user double-clicks the divider on the leading edge of the inspector. clicks a divider to readjust
max
The maximum allowed width for the trailing column inspector
Discussion
Apply this modifier on the content of a inspector(isPresented:content:) to specify a preferred flexible width for the column. Use inspectorColumnWidth(_:) if you need to specify a fixed width.
The following example shows an editor interface with an inspector, which when presented as a trailing-column, has a preferred width of 225 points, maximum of 400, and a minimum of 150 at which point it will collapse, if allowed.
MyEditorView()
    .inspector {
        TextTraitsInspectorView()
            .inspectorColumnWidth(min: 150, ideal: 225, max: 400)
    }
Only some platforms enable flexible inspector columns. If you specify a width that the current presentation environment doesn’t support, SwiftUI may use a different width for your column.
