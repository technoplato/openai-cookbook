Type Method
interpolatingSpring(_:initialVelocity:)
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range of one to zero.

static func interpolatingSpring(
    _ spring: Spring,
    initialVelocity: Double = 0.0
) -> Animation
Discussion
These vales are used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.

static var spring: Animation
A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other spring() or interactiveSpring() animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.
static func spring(Spring, blendDuration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
A persistent spring animation.

static var interactiveSpring: Animation
A convenience for a spring animation with a lower duration value, intended for driving interactive animations.

static var interpolatingSpring: Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
