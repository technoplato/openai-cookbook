Structure
DismissImmersiveSpaceAction
An action that dismisses an immersive space.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct DismissImmersiveSpaceAction
Overview
Use the dismissImmersiveSpace environment value to get the instance of this structure for a given Environment. Then call the instance to dismiss the currently opened space. You call the instance directly because it defines a callAsFunction() method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can define a button that closes the currently opened immersive space:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        ImmersiveSpace(id: "solarSystem") {
            SolarSystemView()
        }
    }
}


struct DismissImmersiveSpaceButton: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace)
    private var dismissImmersiveSpace


    var body: some View {
        Button("Close Solar System Immersive Space") {
            Task {
                await dismissImmersiveSpace()
                print("Dismissing Immersive Space complete")
            }
        }
    }
}
