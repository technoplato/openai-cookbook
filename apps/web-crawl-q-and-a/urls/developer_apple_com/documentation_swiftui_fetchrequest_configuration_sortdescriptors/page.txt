Available when Result inherits NSManagedObject.
Discussion
Set this configuration value to cause a FetchRequest to execute a fetch with a new collection of SortDescriptor instances. If you want to use NSSortDescriptor instances, set nsSortDescriptors instead.
Access this value of a FetchRequest.Configuration structure for a given request by using the sortDescriptors property on the associated FetchedResults instance, either directly or through a Binding.
