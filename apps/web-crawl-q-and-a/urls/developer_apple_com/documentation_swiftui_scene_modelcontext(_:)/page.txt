func modelContext(_ modelContext: ModelContext) -> some Scene
Parameters
modelContext
The model context to set in this scene’s environment.
Discussion
In this example, RecipesApp sets a shared model context to use for all of its windows:
@Model class Recipe { ... }


@main
struct RecipesApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            RecipesList()
        }
        .modelContext(myContext)
    }
}
The environment’s modelContext property will be assigned a myContext. All implicit model context operations in this scene, such as Query properties, will use the environment’s context.
