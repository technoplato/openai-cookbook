func onDeleteCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Delete command, or pressing either the ⌫ (backspace) or ⌦ (forward delete) keys while the view has focus.
func pageCommand<V>(value: Binding<V>, in: ClosedRange<V>, step: V) -> some View
Steps a value through a range in response to page up or page down commands.
func onExitCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Sets up an action that triggers in response to receiving the exit command while the view has focus.
func onPlayPauseCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Play/Pause command.
