Instance Method
padding(_:_:)
Adds an equal padding amount to specific edges of this view.

func padding(
    _ edges: Edge.Set = .all,
    _ length: CGFloat? = nil
) -> some View
Parameters
edges
The set of edges to pad for this view. The default is all.
length
An amount, given in points, to pad this view on the specified edges. If you set the value to nil, SwiftUI uses a platform-specific default amount. The default value of this parameter is nil.
Return Value
A view that’s padded by the specified amount on the specified edges.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add a specified amount of padding to one or more edges of the view. Indicate the edges to pad by naming either a single value from Edge.Set, or by specifying an OptionSet that contains edge values:
VStack {
    Text("Text padded by 20 points on the bottom and trailing edges.")
        .padding([.bottom, .trailing], 20)
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The order in which you apply modifiers matters. The example above applies the padding before applying the border to ensure that the border encompasses the padded region:
You can omit either or both of the parameters. If you omit the length, SwiftUI uses a default amount of padding. If you omit the edges, SwiftUI applies the padding to all edges. Omit both to add a default padding all the way around a view. SwiftUI chooses a default amount of padding that’s appropriate for the platform and the presentation context.
VStack {
    Text("Text with default padding.")
        .padding()
        .border(.gray)
    Text("Unpadded text for comparison.")
        .border(.yellow)
}
The example above looks like this in iOS under typical conditions:
To control the amount of padding independently for each edge, use padding(_:). To pad all outside edges of a view by a specified amount, use padding(_:).
