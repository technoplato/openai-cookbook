Discussion
How a picker using the default picker style appears largely depends on the platform and the view type in which it appears. For example, in a standard view, the default picker styles by platform are:
On iOS and watchOS the default is a wheel.
On macOS, the default is a pop-up button.
On tvOS, the default is a segmented control.
The default picker style may also take into account other factors — like whether the picker appears in a container view — when setting the appearance of a picker.
You can override a picker’s style. To apply the default style to a picker, or to a view that contains pickers, use the pickerStyle(_:) modifier.
