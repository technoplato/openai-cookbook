struct CircularProgressViewStyle
Overview
On watchOS, and in widgets and complications, a circular progress view appears as a gauge with the accessoryCircularCapacity style. If the progress view is indeterminate, the gauge is empty.
In cases where no determinate circular progress view style is available, circular progress views use an indeterminate style.
Use circular to construct the circular progress view style.
