struct VStack<Content> where Content : View
Overview
Unlike LazyVStack, which only renders the views when your app needs to display them, a VStack renders the views all at once, regardless of whether they are on- or offscreen. Use the regular VStack when you have a small number of subviews or don’t want the delayed rendering behavior of the “lazy” version.
The following example shows a simple vertical stack of 10 text views:
var body: some View {
    VStack(
        alignment: .leading,
        spacing: 10
    ) {
        ForEach(
            1...10,
            id: \.self
        ) {
            Text("Item \($0)")
        }
    }
}
Note
If you need a vertical stack that conforms to the Layout protocol, like when you want to create a conditional layout using AnyLayout, use VStackLayout instead.
