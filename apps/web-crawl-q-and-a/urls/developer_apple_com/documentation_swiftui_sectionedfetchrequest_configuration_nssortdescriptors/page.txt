var nsSortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor]
Discussion
Set this configuration value to cause a SectionedFetchRequest to execute a fetch with a new collection of NSSortDescriptor instances. If you want to use SortDescriptor instances, set sortDescriptors instead. Use care to coordinate section and sort updates, as described in SectionedFetchRequest.Configuration.
Access this value for a given request by using the nsSortDescriptors property on the associated SectionedFetchResults instance, either directly or with a Binding.
