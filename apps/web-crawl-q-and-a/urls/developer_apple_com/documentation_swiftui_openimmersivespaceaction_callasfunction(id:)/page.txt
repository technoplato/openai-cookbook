@discardableResult @MainActor
func callAsFunction(id: String) async -> OpenImmersiveSpaceAction.Result
Parameters
id
The identifier of the immersive space to present.
Discussion
The call returns either once the space is presented, or once an error occurred.
If an immersive space is already presented, calling this action has no effect. Dismiss any currently presented immersive space prior to presenting another one.
If the immersive space presents data, the system provides the default value or nil to the the space’s root view.
