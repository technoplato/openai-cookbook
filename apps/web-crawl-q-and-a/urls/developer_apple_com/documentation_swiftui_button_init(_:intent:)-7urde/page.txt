Swift
Initializer
init(_:intent:)
Creates a button that performs an AppIntent and generates its label from a localized string key.
AppIntents
SwiftUI
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
watchOS 10.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    intent: some AppIntent
)
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the button’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the button’s intent.
intent
The AppIntent to execute.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a button with a string variable, use Button/init(_:intent:) instead.
