static let interactive: DismissBehavior
Discussion
Use this behavior when you want to dismiss a window in a manner that is similar to the standard system affordances for window dismissal - for example, when a user clicks the close button.
This is the default behavior on macOS and iOS.
On macOS, dismissing a window using this behavior will not dismiss a window which is currently showing a modal presentation, such as a sheet or alert. Additionally, a document window that is dismissed with this behavior will show the save dialog if there are unsaved changes to the document.
On iOS, dismissing a window using this behavior will dismiss it regardless of any modal presentations being shown.
