Type Property
spring
A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other spring() or interactiveSpring() animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.

static var interactiveSpring: Animation
A convenience for a spring animation with a lower duration value, intended for driving interactive animations.
static func interactiveSpring(response: Double, dampingFraction: Double, blendDuration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
A convenience for a spring animation with a lower response value, intended for driving interactive animations.
static var interpolatingSpring: Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
static func interpolatingSpring(Spring, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range of one to zero.
Beta
static func interpolatingSpring(duration: TimeInterval, bounce: Double, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
static func interpolatingSpring(mass: Double, stiffness: Double, damping: Double, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
