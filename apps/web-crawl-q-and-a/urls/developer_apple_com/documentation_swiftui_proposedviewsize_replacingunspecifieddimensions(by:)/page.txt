func replacingUnspecifiedDimensions(by size: CGSize = CGSize(width: 10, height: 10)) -> CGSize
Parameters
size
A set of concrete values to use for the size proposal in place of any unspecified dimensions. The default value is 10 for both dimensions.
Return Value
A new, fully specified size proposal.
Discussion
Use the default value to prevent a flexible view from disappearing into a zero-sized frame, and ensure the unspecified value remains visible during debugging.
