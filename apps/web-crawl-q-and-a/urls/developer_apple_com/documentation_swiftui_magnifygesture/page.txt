struct MagnifyGesture
Overview
A magnify gesture tracks how a magnification event sequence changes. To recognize a magnify gesture on a view, create and configure the gesture, and then add it to the view using the gesture(_:including:) modifier.
Add a magnify gesture to a Circle that changes its size while the user performs the gesture:
struct MagnifyGestureView: View {
    @GestureState private var magnifyBy = 1.0


    var magnification: some Gesture {
        MagnifyGesture()
            .updating($magnifyBy) { value, gestureState, transaction in
                gestureState = value.magnification
            }
    }


    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
            .scaleEffect(magnifyBy)
            .gesture(magnification)
    }
}
