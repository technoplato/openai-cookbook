Discussion
In the following example, every view in the lazy stack is flexible in both directions and the scroll view settles to container-aligned boundaries.
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(spacing: 0.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            FullScreenItem(item)
        }
    }
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)
