Protocol
UIViewRepresentable
A wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate that view into your SwiftUI view hierarchy.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+

tvOS 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
protocol UIViewRepresentable : View where Self.Body == Never
Overview
Use a UIViewRepresentable instance to create and manage a UIView object in your SwiftUI interface. Adopt this protocol in one of your app’s custom instances, and use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view. The creation and update processes parallel the behavior of SwiftUI views, and you use them to configure your view with your app’s current state information. Use the teardown process to remove your view cleanly from your SwiftUI. For example, you might use the teardown process to notify other objects that the view is disappearing.
To add your view into your SwiftUI interface, create your UIViewRepresentable instance and add it to your SwiftUI interface. The system calls the methods of your representable instance at appropriate times to create and update the view. The following example shows the inclusion of a custom MyRepresentedCustomView structure in the view hierarchy.
struct ContentView: View {
   var body: some View {
      VStack {
         Text("Global Sales")
         MyRepresentedCustomView()
      }
   }
}
The system doesn’t automatically communicate changes occurring within your view to other parts of your SwiftUI interface. When you want your view to coordinate with other SwiftUI views, you must provide a Coordinator instance to facilitate those interactions. For example, you use a coordinator to forward target-action and delegate messages from your view to any SwiftUI views.
Topics
Creating and updating the view
func makeUIView(context: Self.Context) -> Self.UIViewType
Creates the view object and configures its initial state.
Required
func updateUIView(Self.UIViewType, context: Self.Context)
Updates the state of the specified view with new information from SwiftUI.
Required
typealias Context
associatedtype UIViewType : UIView
The type of view to present.
Required
Specifying a size
func sizeThatFits(ProposedViewSize, uiView: Self.UIViewType, context: Self.Context) -> CGSize?
Given a proposed size, returns the preferred size of the composite view.
Required Default implementation provided.
Cleaning up the view
static func dismantleUIView(Self.UIViewType, coordinator: Self.Coordinator)
Cleans up the presented UIKit view (and coordinator) in anticipation of their removal.
Required Default implementation provided.
Providing a custom coordinator object
func makeCoordinator() -> Self.Coordinator
Creates the custom instance that you use to communicate changes from your view to other parts of your SwiftUI interface.
Required Default implementation provided.
associatedtype Coordinator = Void
A type to coordinate with the view.
Required
Performing layout
