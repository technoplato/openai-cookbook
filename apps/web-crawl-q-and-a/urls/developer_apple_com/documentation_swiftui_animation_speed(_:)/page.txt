Swift
Instance Method
speed(_:)
Changes the duration of an animation by adjusting its speed.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func speed(_ speed: Double) -> Animation
Parameters
speed
The speed at which SwiftUI performs the animation.
Return Value
An animation with the adjusted speed.
Discussion
Setting the speed of an animation changes the duration of the animation by a factor of speed. A higher speed value causes a faster animation sequence due to a shorter duration. For example, a one-second animation with a speed of 2.0 completes in half the time (half a second).
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var adjustBy = 100.0


    private var oneSecondAnimation: Animation {
       .easeInOut(duration: 1.0)
    }


    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 40) {
            HStack(alignment: .bottom) {
                Capsule()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 175 - adjustBy)
                Capsule()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 175 + adjustBy)
            }
            .animation(oneSecondAnimation.speed(2.0), value: adjustBy)


            Button("Animate") {
                adjustBy *= -1
            }
        }
    }
}
Play
Setting speed to a lower number slows the animation, extending its duration. For example, a one-second animation with a speed of 0.25 takes four seconds to complete.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var adjustBy = 100.0


    private var oneSecondAnimation: Animation {
       .easeInOut(duration: 1.0)
    }


    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 40) {
            HStack(alignment: .bottom) {
                Capsule()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 175 - adjustBy)
                Capsule()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 175 + adjustBy)
            }
            .animation(oneSecondAnimation.speed(0.25), value: adjustBy)


            Button("Animate") {
                adjustBy *= -1
            }
        }
    }
}
