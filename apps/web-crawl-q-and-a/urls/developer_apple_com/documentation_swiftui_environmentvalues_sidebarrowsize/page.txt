Discussion
On macOS, reflects the value of the “Sidebar icon size” in System Settings’ Appearance settings.
This can be used to update the content shown in the sidebar in response to this size. And it can be overridden to force a sidebar to a particularly size, regardless of the user preference.
On other platforms, the value is always .medium and setting a different value has no effect.
SwiftUI views like Label automatically adapt to the sidebar row size.
