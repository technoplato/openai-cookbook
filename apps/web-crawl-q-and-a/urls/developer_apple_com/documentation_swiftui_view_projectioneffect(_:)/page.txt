Instance Method
projectionEffect(_:)
Applies a projection transformation to this view’s rendered output.

func projectionEffect(_ transform: ProjectionTransform) -> some View
Parameters
transform
A ProjectionTransform to apply to the view.
Discussion
Use projectionEffect(_:) to apply a 3D transformation to the view.
The example below rotates the text 30˚ around the z axis, which is the axis pointing out of the screen:
// This transform represents a 30˚ rotation around the z axis.
let transform = CATransform3DMakeRotation(
    -30 * (.pi / 180), 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)


Text("Projection effects using transforms")
    .projectionEffect(.init(transform))
    .border(Color.gray)
