struct SharePreview<Image, Icon> where Image : Transferable, Icon : Transferable
Overview
Use this type when sharing content that the system can’t preview automatically:
struct Photo: Transferable {
    static var transferRepresentation: some TransferRepresentation {
        ProxyRepresentation(\.image)
    }


    public var image: Image
    public var caption: String
}


struct PhotoView: View {
    let photo: Photo


    var body: View {
        photo.image
            .toolbar {
                ShareLink(
                    item: photo,
                    preview: SharePreview(
                        photo.caption,
                        image: photo.image))
            }
    }
}
You can also provide a preview to speed up the sharing process. In the following example the preview appears immediately; if you omit the preview instead, the system fetches the link’s metadata over the network:
ShareLink(
    item: URL(string: "https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/")!,
    preview: SharePreview(
        "SwiftUI",
        image: Image("SwiftUI"))
You can provide unique previews for each item in a collection of items that a ShareLink links to:
ShareLink(items: photos) { photo in
    SharePreview(photo.caption, image: photo.image)
}
The share interface decides how to combine those previews.
Each preview specifies text and images that describe an item of the type. The preview’s image parameter is typically a full-size representation of the item. For instance, if the system prepares a preview for a link to a webpage, the image might be the hero image on that webpage.
The preview’s icon parameter is typically a thumbnail-sized representation of the source of the item. For instance, if the system prepares a preview for a link to a webpage, the icon might be an image that represents the website overall.
The system may reuse a single preview representation for multiple previews, and show different images in each context. For more information and recommended sizes for each image, see TN2444: Best Practices for Link Previews in Messages.
