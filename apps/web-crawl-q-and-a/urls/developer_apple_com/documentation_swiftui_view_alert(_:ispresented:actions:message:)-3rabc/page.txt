Swift
Instance Method
alert(_:isPresented:actions:message:)
Presents an alert with a message when a given condition is true using a string variable as a title.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func alert<S, A, M>(
    _ title: S,
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    @ViewBuilder actions: () -> A,
    @ViewBuilder message: () -> M
) -> some View where S : StringProtocol, A : View, M : View
Parameters
title
A text string used as the title of the alert.
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to false and dismisses.
actions
A ViewBuilder returning the alert’s actions.
message
A ViewBuilder returning the message for the alert.
Discussion
In the example below, a login form conditionally presents an alert by setting the didFail state variable. When the form sets the value to to true, the system displays an alert with an “OK” action.
struct Login: View {
    @State private var didFail = false
    let alertTitle: String = "Login failed."


    var body: some View {
        LoginForm(didFail: $didFail)
            .alert(
                alertTitle,
                isPresented: $didFail
            ) {
                Button("OK") {
                    // Handle the acknowledgement.
                }
            } message: {
                Text("Please check your credentials and try again.")
            }
    }
}
All actions in an alert dismiss the alert after the action runs. The default button is shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the defaultAction keyboard shortcut.
The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.
If no actions are present, the system includes a standard “OK” action. No default cancel action is provided. If you want to show a cancel action, use a button with a role of cancel.
On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, alerts only support controls with labels that are Text. Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
Only unstyled text is supported for the message.
