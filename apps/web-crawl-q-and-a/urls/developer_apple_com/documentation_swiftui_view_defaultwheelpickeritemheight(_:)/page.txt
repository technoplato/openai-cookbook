func defaultWheelPickerItemHeight(_ height: CGFloat) -> some View
Parameters
height
The height for the picker items.
Discussion
Use defaultWheelPickerItemHeight(_:) when you need to change the default item height in a picker control. In this example, the view sets the default height for picker elements to 30 points.
struct DefaultWheelPickerItemHeight: View {
    @State private var selected = 1
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Picker(selection: $selected, label: Text("Favorite Color")) {
                Text("Red").tag(1)
                Text("Green").tag(2)
                Text("Blue").tag(3)
                Text("Other").tag(4)
            }
        }
        .defaultWheelPickerItemHeight(30)
    }
}
