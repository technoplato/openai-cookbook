Initializer
init(_:sources:isOn:)
Creates a toggle representing a collection of values that generates its label from a string.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<S, C>(
    _ title: S,
    sources: C,
    isOn: KeyPath<C.Element, Binding<Bool>>
) where S : StringProtocol, C : RandomAccessCollection
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
title
A string that describes the purpose of the toggle.
sources
A collection of values used as the source for rendering the Toggle’s state.
isOn
The key path of the values that determines whether the toggle is on, mixed or off.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the title similar to init(_:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
The following example creates a single toggle that represents the state of multiple alarms:
struct Alarm: Hashable, Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var isOn = false
    var name = ""
}


@State private var alarms = [
    Alarm(isOn: true, name: "Morning"),
    Alarm(isOn: false, name: "Evening")
]


Toggle("Enable all alarms", sources: $alarms, isOn: \.isOn)
