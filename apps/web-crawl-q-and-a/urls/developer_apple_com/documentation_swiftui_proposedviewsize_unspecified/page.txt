static let unspecified: ProposedViewSize
Discussion
Both dimensions contain nil in this size proposal. Subviews of a custom layout return their ideal size when you propose this value using the dimensions(in:) method. A custom layout should also return its ideal size from the sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:) method for this value.
