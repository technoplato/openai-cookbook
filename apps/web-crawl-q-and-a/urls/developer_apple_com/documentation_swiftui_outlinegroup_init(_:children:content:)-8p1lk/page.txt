Initializer
init(_:children:content:)
Creates an outline group from a root data element and a key path to its children.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<DataElement>(
    _ root: DataElement,
    children: KeyPath<DataElement, Data?>,
    @TableRowBuilder<DataElement> content: @escaping (DataElement) -> Leaf
) where ID == DataElement.ID, DataElement == Data.Element
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID is Data.Element.ID, Parent conforms to TableRowContent, Parent is Leaf, Leaf is Subgroup, and Data.Element is Parent.TableRowValue.
Parameters
root
The root of a collection of tree-structured, identified data.
children
A key path to a property whose non-nil value gives the children of data. A non-nil but empty value denotes an element capable of having children that’s currently childless, such as an empty directory in a file system. On the other hand, if the property at the key path is nil, then the outline group treats data as a leaf in the tree, like a regular file in a file system.
content
A table row builder that produces a row based on an element in data.
Discussion
This initializer exposes content as a TableRowBuilder to allow custom table row content for each data element.
This initializer creates an instance that uniquely identifies table rows across updates based on the identity of the underlying data element.
All generated disclosure groups begin in the collapsed state.
