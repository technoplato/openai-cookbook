enum SidebarRowSize
Overview
On macOS, sidebar rows have three different sizes: small, medium, and large. The size is primarily controlled by the current users’ “Sidebar Icon Size” in Appearance settings, and applies to all applications.
On all other platforms, the only supported sidebar size is .medium.
This size can be read or written in the environment using EnvironmentValues.sidebarRowSize.
