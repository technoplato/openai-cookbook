Instance Method
fileExporter(isPresented:document:contentType:defaultFilename:onCompletion:)
Presents a system interface for exporting a document that’s stored in a reference type, like a class, to a file on disk.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileExporter<D>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    document: D?,
    contentType: UTType,
    defaultFilename: String? = nil,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<URL, Error>) -> Void
) -> some View where D : ReferenceFileDocument
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the interface should be shown.
document
The in-memory document to export.
contentType
The content type to use for the exported file.
defaultFilename
If provided, the default name to use for the exported file, which will the user will have an opportunity to edit prior to the export.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has has succeeded or failed.
result
A Result indicating whether the operation succeeded or failed.
Discussion
In order for the interface to appear, both isPresented must be true and document must not be nil. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCompletion will not be called.
The contentType provided must be included within the document type’s writableContentTypes, otherwise the first valid writable content type will be used instead.
