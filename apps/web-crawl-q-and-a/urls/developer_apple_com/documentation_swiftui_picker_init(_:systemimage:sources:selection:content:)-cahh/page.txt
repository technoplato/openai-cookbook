Swift
Initializer
init(_:systemImage:sources:selection:content:)
Creates a picker that generates its label from a localized string key.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<C>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    systemImage: String,
    sources: C,
    selection: KeyPath<C.Element, Binding<SelectionValue>>,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> Content
) where C : RandomAccessCollection, C.Element == Binding<SelectionValue>
Available when Label is Label<Text, Image>, SelectionValue conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
titleKey
A localized string key that describes the purpose of selecting an option.
systemImage
The name of the image resource to lookup.
sources
A collection of values used as the source for displaying the Picker’s selection.
selection
The key path of the values that determines the currently-selected options. When a user selects an option from the picker, the values at the key path of all items in the sources collection are updated with the selected option.
content
A view that contains the set of options.
Discussion
If the wrapped values of the collection passed to sources are not all the same, some styles render the selection in a mixed state. The specific presentation depends on the style. For example, a Picker with a menu style uses dashes instead of checkmarks to indicate the selected values.
In the following example, a picker in a document inspector controls the thickness of borders for the currently-selected shapes, which can be of any number.
enum Thickness: String, CaseIterable, Identifiable {
    case thin
    case regular
    case thick


    var id: String { rawValue }
}


struct Border {
    var color: Color
    var thickness: Thickness
}


@State private var selectedObjectBorders = [
    Border(color: .black, thickness: .thin),
    Border(color: .red, thickness: .thick)
]


Picker(
    "Border Thickness",
    sources: $selectedObjectBorders,
    selection: \.thickness
) {
    ForEach(Thickness.allCases) { thickness in
        Text(thickness.rawValue)
    }
}
