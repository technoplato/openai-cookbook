Type Method
snappy(duration:extraBounce:)
A spring animation with a predefined duration and small amount of bounce that feels more snappy and can be tuned.

static func snappy(
    duration: TimeInterval = 0.5,
    extraBounce: Double = 0.0
) -> Animation
Parameters
duration
The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring. This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for very bouncy springs, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.
extraBounce
How much additional bounce should be added to the base bounce of 0.15.
blendDuration
The duration in seconds over which to interpolate changes to the duration.
