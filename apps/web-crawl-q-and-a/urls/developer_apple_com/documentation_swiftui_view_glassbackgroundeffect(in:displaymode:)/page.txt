    in shape: S,
    displayMode: GlassBackgroundDisplayMode = .always
) -> some View where S : InsettableShape
Parameters
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to InsettableShape that SwiftUI draws behind the view. For unsupported shapes, it will resolve to a rectangle glass material.
displayMode
The GlassBackgroundDisplayMode of glass background. The default visibility is .always.
Discussion
A volumetric glass material is a 3D object includes thickness, specular, glass blur, shadow, and others. Because of its physical depth attribute, it influences Z-axis layout; the UI content should be generally placed in glass instead of on top of it as .overlay or ZStack. A shape with rounded corners is recommended. If shape style is not supported, it will resolve to a rectangle glass material.
