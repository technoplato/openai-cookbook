mutating func rotate(by angle: Angle)
Parameters
angle
The amount to rotate.
Discussion
Calling this method is equivalent to updating the context’s transform directly using the angle parameter:
transform = transform.rotated(by: angle.radians)

Applying transforms
func scaleBy(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)
Scales subsequent drawing operations by an amount in each dimension.
func translateBy(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)
Moves subsequent drawing operations by an amount in each dimension.
func concatenate(CGAffineTransform)
Appends the given transform to the context’s existing transform.
var transform: CGAffineTransform
The current transform matrix, defining user space coordinates.
