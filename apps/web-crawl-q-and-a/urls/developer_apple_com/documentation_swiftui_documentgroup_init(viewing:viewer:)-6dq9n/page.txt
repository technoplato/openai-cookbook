The type of document your app can view.
viewer
The viewing UI for the provided document.
Discussion
Use this method to create a document group that can view files of a specific type. The example below creates a new document viewer for MyImageFormatDocument and displays them with MyImageFormatViewer:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        DocumentGroup(viewing: MyImageFormatDocument.self) { file in
            MyImageFormatViewer(image: file.document)
        }
    }
}
You tell the system about the app’s role with respect to the document type by setting the CFBundleTypeRole Info.plist key with a value of Viewer.
