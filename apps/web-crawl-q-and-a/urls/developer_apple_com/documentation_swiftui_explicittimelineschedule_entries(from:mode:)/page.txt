func entries(
    from startDate: Date,
    mode: TimelineScheduleMode
) -> Entries
Parameters
startDate
The date from which the sequence begins. This particular implementation of the protocol method ignores the start date.
mode
The mode for the update schedule. This particular implementation of the protocol method ignores the mode.
Return Value
The sequence of dates that you provided at initialization.
Discussion
A TimelineView that you create with a schedule calls this TimelineSchedule method to ask the schedule when to update its content. The explicit timeline schedule implementation of this method returns the unmodified sequence of dates that you provided when you created the schedule with explicit(_:). As a result, this particular implementation ignores the startDate and mode parameters.
