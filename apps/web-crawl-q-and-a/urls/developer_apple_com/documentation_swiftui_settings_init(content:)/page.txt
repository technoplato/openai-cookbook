Initializer

Discussion
Use Settings(content:) to add a preferences scene when you declare your app using the App protocol.
The example below shows the view content for the settings scene added to the SwiftUI app delegate:
@main
struct MacSwiftUISnippets: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        #if os(macOS)
        Settings(content: {
            SettingsView()
        }
        #endif
    }
}
When you use an App declaration for multiple platforms, compile the settings scene only in macOS, as shown in the example above.
