Type Alias
TimelineViewDefaultContext
Information passed to a timeline view’s content callback.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
typealias TimelineViewDefaultContext = TimelineView<EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule, Never>.Context
Discussion
The context includes both the date from the schedule that triggered the callback, and a cadence that you can use to customize the appearance of your view. For example, you might choose to display the second hand of an analog clock only when the cadence is TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds or faster.
Note
This type alias uses a specific concrete instance of TimelineView.Context that all timeline views can use. It does this to prevent introducing an unnecessary generic parameter dependency on the context type.
