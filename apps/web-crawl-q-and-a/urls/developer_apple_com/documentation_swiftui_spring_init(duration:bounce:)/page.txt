init(duration:bounce:)
Creates a spring with the specified duration and bounce.

init(
    duration: TimeInterval = 0.5,
    bounce: Double = 0.0
)
Parameters
duration
Defines the pace of the spring. This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for springs with very large bounce values, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.
bounce
How bouncy the spring should be. A value of 0 indicates no bounces (a critically damped spring), positive values indicate increasing amounts of bounciness up to a maximum of 1.0 (corresponding to undamped oscillation), and negative values indicate overdamped springs with a minimum value of -1.0.
