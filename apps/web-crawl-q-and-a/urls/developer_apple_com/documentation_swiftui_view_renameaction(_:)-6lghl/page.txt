func renameAction(_ action: @escaping () -> Void) -> some View
Parameters
action
A closure to run when renaming.
Return Value
A view that has the specified rename action.
Discussion
Use this modifier in conjunction with the RenameButton to implement standard rename interactions. A rename button receives its action from the environment. Use this modifier to customize the action provided to the rename button.
struct RowView: View {
    @State private var text = ""
    @FocusState private var isFocused: Bool


    var body: some View {
        TextField(text: $item.name) {
            Text("Prompt")
        }
        .focused($isFocused)
        .contextMenu {
            RenameButton()
            // ... your own custom actions
        }
        .renameAction { isFocused = true }
}
When the user taps the rename button in the context menu, the rename action focuses the text field by setting the isFocused property to true.
