Instance Method
rotation3DEffect(_:axis:anchor:)
Rotates this view by the specified angle about an axis and anchor point.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func rotation3DEffect(
    _ angle: Angle,
    axis: RotationAxis3D,
    anchor: UnitPoint3D = .center
) -> some View
Parameters
angle
The angle by which to rotate this view.
axis
The axis about which to rotate this view.
anchor
The anchor point about which to rotate this view. Defaults to center.
Return Value
A view that rotates this view by angle about axis and anchor.
Discussion
The original dimensions of the view are considered to be unchanged by rotating the contents.
For example, to rotate a box by 45° about the Y axis:
Model3D("robot")
    .rotationEffect(.degrees(45), axis: .y)
