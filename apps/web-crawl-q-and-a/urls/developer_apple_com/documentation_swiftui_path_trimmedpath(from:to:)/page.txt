func trimmedPath(
    from: CGFloat,
    to: CGFloat
) -> Path
Discussion
The returned path contains the region between from and to, both of which must be fractions between zero and one defining points linearly-interpolated along the path.

Transforming the path
func applying(CGAffineTransform) -> Path
Returns a path constructed by applying the transform to all points of the path.
func offsetBy(dx: CGFloat, dy: CGFloat) -> Path
Returns a path constructed by translating all its points.
