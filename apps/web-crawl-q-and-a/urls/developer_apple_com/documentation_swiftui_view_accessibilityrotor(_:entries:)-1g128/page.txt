func accessibilityRotor<Content>(
    _ systemRotor: AccessibilitySystemRotor,
    @AccessibilityRotorContentBuilder entries: @escaping () -> Content
) -> some View where Content : AccessibilityRotorContent
Parameters
systemRotor
The system-provided Rotor that will be overridden by this custom Rotor.
entries
Content used to generate Rotor entries. This can include AccessibilityRotorEntry structs, as well as constructs such as if and ForEach.
Discussion
An Accessibility Rotor is a shortcut for Accessibility users to quickly navigate to specific elements of the user interface, and optionally specific ranges of text within those elements. Replacing system Rotors this way is useful when the System Rotor does not automatically pick up elements that aren’t on-screen, such as elements far down in a LazyVStack or List.
In the following example, a Message application adds a Rotor allowing the user to navigate through all the ranges of text containing headings.
extension Message {
    // Ranges of special areas in the `content` text. Calculated
    // when `content` is set and then cached so that we don't have
    // to re-compute them.
    var contentHeadingRanges: [Range<String.Index>]
}


struct MessageContentView: View {
    TextEditor(.constant(message.content))
        .accessibilityRotor(.heading) {
            ForEach(range in message.contentHeadingRanges) {
                AccessibilityRotorEntry(textRange: range)
            }
        }
}

Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor.
func accessibilityRotor<EntryModel>(AccessibilitySystemRotor, entries: [EntryModel], entryLabel: KeyPath<EntryModel, String>) -> some View
Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor.
func accessibilityRotor(AccessibilitySystemRotor, textRanges: [Range<String.Index>]) -> some View
Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor. The Rotor will be attached to the current Accessibility element, and each entry will go the specified range of that element.
struct AccessibilitySystemRotor
Designates a Rotor that replaces one of the automatic, system-provided Rotors with a developer-provided Rotor.
