func accessibilityActivationPoint(_ activationPoint: UnitPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Discussion
Use this modifier to ensure that the activation point for a small element remains accurate even if you present a larger version of the element to VoiceOver.
If an activation point is not provided, an activation point will be derrived from one of the accessibility elements decendents or from the center of the accessibility frame.

Making gestures accessible
func accessibilityActivationPoint(CGPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.
func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.
Beta
func accessibilityZoomAction((AccessibilityZoomGestureAction) -> Void) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>

struct AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions
An option set that defines the functionality of a view’s direct touch area.
Beta
struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction
Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.
