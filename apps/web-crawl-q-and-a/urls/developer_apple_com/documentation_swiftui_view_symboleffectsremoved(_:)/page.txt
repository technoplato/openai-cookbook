Discussion
The following example adds a repeating pulse effect to two symbol images, but then disables the effect on one of them:
VStack {
    Image(systemName: "bolt.slash.fill") // does not pulse
        .symbolEffectsRemoved()
    Image(systemName: "folder.fill.badge.person.crop") // pulses
}
.symbolEffect(.pulse)
