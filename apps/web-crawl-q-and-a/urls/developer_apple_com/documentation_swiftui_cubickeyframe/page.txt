struct CubicKeyframe<Value> where Value : Animatable
Overview
If you don’t specify a start or end velocity, SwiftUI automatically computes a curve that maintains smooth motion between keyframes.
Adjacent cubic keyframes result in a Catmull-Rom spline.
If a cubic keyframe follows a different type of keyframe, such as a linear keyframe, the end velocity of the segment defined by the previous keyframe will be used as the starting velocity.
Likewise, if a cubic keyframe is followed by a different type of keyframe, the initial velocity of the next segment is used as the end velocity of the segment defined by this keyframe.
Topics
Creating the keyframe
init(Value, duration: TimeInterval, startVelocity: Value?, endVelocity: Value?)
Creates a new keyframe using the given value and timestamp.
