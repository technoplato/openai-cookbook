Instance Method
musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented:options:onLoadCompletion:)
Initiates the process of presenting a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music when the isPresented binding is true.
MusicKit
SwiftUI
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
func musicSubscriptionOffer(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    options: MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options = .default,
    onLoadCompletion: @escaping ((Error)?) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that you can set to true to show a sheet with subscription offers for Apple Music.
options
Options to use for loading the subscription offer for Apple Music.
onLoadCompletion
The function to call upon completing the initial loading process for this subscription offer. The subscription offer UI becomes visible when it calls this function with the error argument as nil. If there is an error in the loading process, the subscription offer calls this function with a non-nil error, and it resets the isPresented binding to false.
Discussion
The example below displays a simple button that the user can activate to begin presenting subscription offers for Apple Music. The action handler of this button initiates the presentation of those offers by setting the isShowingOffer variable to true.
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(isPresented: $isShowingOffer)
    }
}
You can also configure the Apple Music subscription offer by creating an instance of MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options, setting relevant properties on it, and passing it to .musicSubscriptionOffer(…). For example, to present contextual offers that highlight a specific album, you can configure the subscription offer like the following:
struct MusicSubscriptionOfferButton: View {
    var album: Album
    @State var isShowingOffer = false
    @State var offerOptions = MusicSubscriptionOffer.Options(
        affiliateToken: "<affiliate_token>", 
        campaignToken: "<campaign_token>"
    )


    var body: some View {
        Button("Apple Music Subscription Offer") {
            offerOptions.itemID = album.id
            isShowingOffer = true
        }
        .musicSubscriptionOffer(
            isPresented: $isShowingOffer, 
            options: offerOptions
        )
    }
}
The initial value of offerOptions includes relevant tokens (affiliate and campaign tokens) that allow you to receive compensation for referring new Apple Music subscribers. For more information, see this presentation of the Apple Services Performance Partners Program.
You may also set isShowingOffer to false to programmatically dismiss the subscription offer (or to abort its loading process).
