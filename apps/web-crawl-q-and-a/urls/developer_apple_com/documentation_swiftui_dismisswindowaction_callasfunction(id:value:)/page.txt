    id: String,
    value: D
) where D : Decodable, D : Encodable, D : Hashable
Parameters
id
The identifier of the scene to dismiss.
value
The value which is currently presented.
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the dismissWindow action with an identifier and a value:
dismissWindow(id: "message", value: message.id)
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
