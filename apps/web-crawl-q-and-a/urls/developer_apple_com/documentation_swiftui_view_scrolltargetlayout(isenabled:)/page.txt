func scrollTargetLayout(isEnabled: Bool = true) -> some View
Discussion
This modifier works together with the ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior to ensure that scroll views align to view based content.
Apply this modifier to layout containers like LazyHStack or VStack within a ScrollView that contain the main repeating content of your ScrollView.
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(spacing: 10.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            ItemView(item)
        }
    }
    .scrollTargetLayout()
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)
Scroll target layouts act as a convenience for applying a View/scrollTarget(isEnabled:) modifier to each views in the layout.
A scroll target layout will ensure that any target layout nested within the primary one will not also become a scroll target layout.
LazyHStack { // a scroll target layout
    VStack { ... } // not a scroll target layout
    LazyHStack { ... } // also not a scroll target layout
}
.scrollTargetLayout()
