) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The visibility of the search suggestions for the specified locations.
placements
The set of locations in which to set the visibility of search suggestions.
Discussion
SwiftUI presents search suggestions differently depending on several factors, like the platform, the position of the search field, and the size class. Use this modifier when you want to only display suggestions in certain ways under certain conditions. For example, you might choose to display suggestions in a menu when possible, but directly filter your data source otherwise.
enum FruitSuggestion: String, Identifiable {
    case apple, banana, orange
    var id: Self { self }
}


@State private var text = ""
@State private var suggestions: [FruitSuggestion] = []


var body: some View {
    MainContent()
        .searchable(text: $text) {
            ForEach(suggestions) { suggestion
                Text(suggestion.rawValue)
                    .searchCompletion(suggestion.rawValue)
            }
            .searchSuggestions(.hidden, for: .content)
        }
}
