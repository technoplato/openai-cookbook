Instance Method
repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)
Repeats the animation for a specific number of times.

func repeatCount(
    _ repeatCount: Int,
    autoreverses: Bool = true
) -> Animation
Parameters
repeatCount
The number of times that the animation repeats. Each repeated sequence starts at the beginning when autoreverse is false.
autoreverses
A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation sequence plays in reverse after playing forward. Autoreverse counts towards the repeatCount. For instance, a repeatCount of one plays the animation forward once, but it doesn’t play in reverse even if autoreverse is true. When autoreverse is true and repeatCount is 2, the animation moves forward, then reverses, then stops.
Return Value
An animation that repeats for specific number of times.
Discussion
Use this method to repeat the animation a specific number of times. For example, in the following code, the animation moves a truck from one edge of the view to the other edge. It repeats this animation three times.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var driveForward = true


    private var driveAnimation: Animation {
        .easeInOut
        .repeatCount(3, autoreverses: true)
        .speed(0.5)
    }


    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: driveForward ? .leading : .trailing, spacing: 40) {
            Image(systemName: "box.truck")
                .font(.system(size: 48))
                .animation(driveAnimation, value: driveForward)


            HStack {
                Spacer()
                Button("Animate") {
                    driveForward.toggle()
                }
                Spacer()
            }
        }
    }
}
Play
The first time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the view. The second time the animation runs, the truck moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge because autoreverse is true. If autoreverse were false, the truck would jump back to leading edge before moving to the trailing edge. The third time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading to the trailing edge of the view.
