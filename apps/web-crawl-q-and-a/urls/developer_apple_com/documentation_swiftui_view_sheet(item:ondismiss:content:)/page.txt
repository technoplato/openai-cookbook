Instance Method
sheet(item:onDismiss:content:)
Presents a sheet using the given item as a data source for the sheet’s content.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func sheet<Item, Content>(
    item: Binding<Item?>,
    onDismiss: (() -> Void)? = nil,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Item) -> Content
) -> some View where Item : Identifiable, Content : View
Parameters
item
A binding to an optional source of truth for the sheet. When item is non-nil, the system passes the item’s content to the modifier’s closure. You display this content in a sheet that you create that the system displays to the user. If item changes, the system dismisses the sheet and replaces it with a new one using the same process.
onDismiss
The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
content
A closure returning the content of the sheet.
Discussion
Use this method when you need to present a modal view with content from a custom data source. The example below shows a custom data source InventoryItem that the content closure uses to populate the display the action sheet shows to the user:
struct ShowPartDetail: View {
    @State private var sheetDetail: InventoryItem?


    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Part Details") {
            sheetDetail = InventoryItem(
                id: "0123456789",
                partNumber: "Z-1234A",
                quantity: 100,
                name: "Widget")
        }
        .sheet(item: $sheetDetail,
               onDismiss: didDismiss) { detail in
            VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
                Text("Part Number: \(detail.partNumber)")
                Text("Name: \(detail.name)")
                Text("Quantity On-Hand: \(detail.quantity)")
            }
            .onTapGesture {
                sheetDetail = nil
            }
        }
    }


    func didDismiss() {
        // Handle the dismissing action.
    }
}


struct InventoryItem: Identifiable {
    var id: String
    let partNumber: String
    let quantity: Int
    let name: String
}
In vertically compact environments, such as iPhone in landscape orientation, a sheet presentation automatically adapts to appear as a full-screen cover. Use the presentationCompactAdaptation(_:) or presentationCompactAdaptation(horizontal:vertical:) modifier to override this behavior.
