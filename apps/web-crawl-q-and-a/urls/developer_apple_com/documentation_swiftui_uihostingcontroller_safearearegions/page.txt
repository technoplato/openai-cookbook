Instance Property
safeAreaRegions
The safe area regions that this view controller adds to its view.
iOS 16.4+
iPadOS 16.4+
Mac Catalyst 16.4+
tvOS 16.4+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
var safeAreaRegions: SafeAreaRegions { get set }
Available when Content conforms to View.
Discussion
An example of when this is appropriate to use is when hosting content that you know should never be affected by the safe area, such as a custom scrollable container. Disabling a safe area region omits it from the SwiftUI layout system altogether.
The default value is SafeAreaRegions.all.
