struct DismissBehavior
Overview
Use values of this type to control window dismissal during the current transaction.
For example, to dismiss windows showing a modal presentation that would otherwise prohibit dismissal, use the destructive behavior:
struct DismissWindowButton: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissWindow) private var dismissWindow


    var body: some View {
        Button("Close Auxiliary Window") {
            withTransaction(\.dismissBehavior, .destructive) {
                dismissWindow(id: "auxiliary")
            }
        }
    }
}
