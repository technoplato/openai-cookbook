Type Property
elliptical
The list style that describes the behavior and appearance of an elliptical list.
watchOS 7.0+
static var elliptical: EllipticalListStyle { get }
Available when Self is EllipticalListStyle.
Discussion
On watchOS, the elliptical list style uses a transform for items rolling off the top or bottom of the list, as if on a rounded surface that faces the user.
Apple Watch Series 3 does not support this style and will instead fall back to using the plain style.
