init(
    colorSpace: Color.RGBColorSpace = .sRGB,
    red: Float,
    green: Float,
    blue: Float,
    opacity: Float = 1
)
Parameters
colorSpace
The profile that specifies how to interpret the color for display. The default is Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGB.
red
The amount of red in the color.
green
The amount of green in the color.
blue
The amount of blue in the color.
opacity
An optional degree of opacity, given in the range 0 to 1. A value of 0 means 100% transparency, while a value of 1 means 100% opacity. The default is 1.
Discussion
A standard sRGB color space clamps each color component — red, green, and blue — to a range of 0 to 1, but SwiftUI colors use an extended sRGB color space, so you can use component values outside that range. This makes it possible to create colors using the Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGB or Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGBLinear color space that make full use of the wider gamut of a diplay that supports Color.RGBColorSpace.displayP3.
