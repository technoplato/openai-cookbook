Instance Method
coordinateSpace(_:)
Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.

func coordinateSpace(_ name: NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View
Parameters
name
A name used to identify this coordinate space.
Discussion
Use coordinateSpace(_:) to allow another function to find and operate on a view and operate on dimensions relative to that view.
The example below demonstrates how a nested view can find and operate on its enclosing view’s coordinate space:
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var location = CGPoint.zero


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Color.red.frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                .overlay(circle)
            Text("Location: \(Int(location.x)), \(Int(location.y))")
        }
        .coordinateSpace(.named("stack"))
    }


    var circle: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 25, height: 25)
            .gesture(drag)
            .padding(5)
    }


    var drag: some Gesture {
        DragGesture(coordinateSpace: .named("stack"))
            .onChanged { info in location = info.location }
    }
}
Here, the VStack in the ContentView named “stack” is composed of a red frame with a custom Circle view overlay(_:alignment:) at its center.
The circle view has an attached DragGesture that targets the enclosing VStack’s coordinate space. As the gesture recognizer’s closure registers events inside circle it stores them in the shared location state variable and the VStack displays the coordinates in a Text view.
