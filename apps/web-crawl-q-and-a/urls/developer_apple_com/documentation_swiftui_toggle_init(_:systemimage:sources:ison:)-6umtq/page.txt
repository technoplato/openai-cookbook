Swift
Initializer
init(_:systemImage:sources:isOn:)
Creates a toggle representing a collection of values that generates its label from a localized string key and system image.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<C>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    systemImage: String,
    sources: C,
    isOn: KeyPath<C.Element, Binding<Bool>>
) where C : RandomAccessCollection
Available when Label is Label<Text, Image>.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the toggle’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the toggle.
systemImage
The name of the image resource to lookup.
sources
A collection of values used as the source for rendering the Toggle’s state.
isOn
The key path of the values that determines whether the toggle is on, mixed or off.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
The following example creates a single toggle that represents the state of multiple alarms:
struct Alarm: Hashable, Identifiable {
    var id = UUID()
    var isOn = false
    var name = ""
}


@State private var alarms = [
    Alarm(isOn: true, name: "Morning"),
    Alarm(isOn: false, name: "Evening")
]


Toggle("Enable all alarms", sources: $alarms, isOn: \.isOn)
