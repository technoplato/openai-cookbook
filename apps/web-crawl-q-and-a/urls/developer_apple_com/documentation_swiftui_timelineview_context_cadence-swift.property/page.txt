let cadence: TimelineView<Schedule, Content>.Context.Cadence
Discussion
Use this value to hide information that updates faster than the view’s current update rate. For example, you could hide the millisecond component of a digital timer when the cadence is anything slower than TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live.
Because the TimelineView.Context.Cadence enumeration conforms to the Comparable protocol, you can compare cadences with relational operators. Slower cadences have higher values, so you could perform the check described above with the following comparison:
let hideMilliseconds = cadence > .live
