Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a custom vertical alignment of the specified type.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(_ id: AlignmentID.Type)
Parameters
id
The type of an identifier that uniquely identifies a vertical alignment.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create a custom vertical alignment. Define an AlignmentID type, and then use that type to create a new static property on VerticalAlignment:
private struct FirstThirdAlignment: AlignmentID {
    static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
        context.height / 3
    }
}


extension VerticalAlignment {
    static let firstThird = VerticalAlignment(FirstThirdAlignment.self)
}
Every vertical alignment instance that you create needs a unique identifier. For more information, see AlignmentID.
