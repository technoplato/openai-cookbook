Swift
Instance Method
fileImporter(isPresented:allowedContentTypes:allowsMultipleSelection:onCompletion:)
Presents a system interface for allowing the user to import multiple files.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileImporter(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    allowedContentTypes: [UTType],
    allowsMultipleSelection: Bool,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<[URL], Error>) -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the interface should be shown.
allowedContentTypes
The list of supported content types which can be imported.
allowsMultipleSelection
Whether the importer allows the user to select more than one file to import.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has succeeded or failed. To access the received URLs, call startAccessingSecurityScopedResource. When the access is no longer required, call stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource.
result
A Result indicating whether the operation succeeded or failed.
Discussion
In order for the interface to appear, isPresented must be true. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCompletion will not be called.
Note
This dialog provides security-scoped URLs. Call the startAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to access or bookmark the URLs, and the stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to release the access.
For example, a button that allows the user to choose multiple PDF files for the application to combine them later, might look like this:
   struct PickPDFsButton: View {
       @State private var showFileImporter = false
       var handlePickedPDF: (URL) -> Void


       var body: some View {
           Button {
               showFileImporter = true
           } label: {
               Label("Choose PDFs to combine", systemImage: "doc.circle")
           }
           .fileImporter(
               isPresented: $showFileImporter,
               allowedContentTypes: [.pdf],
               allowsMultipleSelection: true
           ) { result in
               switch result {
               case .success(let files):
                   files.forEach { file in
                       // gain access to the directory
                       let gotAccess = file.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
                       if !gotAccess { return }
                       // access the directory URL
                       // (read templates in the directory, make a bookmark, etc.)
                       handlePickedPDF(file)
                       // release access
                       file.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
                   }
               case .failure(let error):
                   // handle error
                   print(error)
               }
           }
       }
   }
Note
Changing allowedContentTypes or allowsMultipleSelection while the file importer is presented will have no immediate effect, however will apply the next time it is presented.
