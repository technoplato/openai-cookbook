Type Method
animated(_:)
Creates a new configuration that discretely animates the transition when the view becomes visible.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta

static func animated(_ animation: Animation = .default) -> ScrollTransitionConfiguration
Parameters
animation
The animation to use when transitioning between states.
Return Value
A configuration that discretely animates between transition phases.
Discussion
Unlike the interactive configuration, the transition isn’t interpolated as the scroll view is scrolled. Instead, the transition phase only changes once the threshold has been reached, at which time the given animation is used to animate to the new phase.
