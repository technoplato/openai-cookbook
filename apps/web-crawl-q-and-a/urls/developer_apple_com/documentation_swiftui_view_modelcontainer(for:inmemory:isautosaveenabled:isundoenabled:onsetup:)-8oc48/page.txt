Instance Method
modelContainer(for:inMemory:isAutosaveEnabled:isUndoEnabled:onSetup:)
Sets the model container in this view for storing the provided model types, creating a new container if necessary, and also sets a model context for that container in this view’s environment.

func modelContainer(
    for modelTypes: [PersistentModel.Type],
    inMemory: Bool = false,
    isAutosaveEnabled: Bool = true,
    isUndoEnabled: Bool = false,
    onSetup: @escaping (Result<ModelContainer, Error>) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View
Parameters
modelTypes
The model types defining the schema used to create the model container.
inMemory
Whether the container should store data only in memory.
isAutosaveEnabled
true if autosave is enabled.
isUndoEnabled
use undoManager in the view’s environment to manage undo operations for the model container.
onSetup
A callback that will be invoked when the creation of the container has has succeeded or failed.
Discussion
In this example, the RecipesList view sets a model container to use for all of its contents, configured to store instances of Recipe and Ingredient:
@Model class Recipe { ... }
@Model class Ingredient { ... }
...
RecipesList()
    .modelContainer(for: [Recipe.self, Ingredient.self])
The environment’s modelContext property will be assigned a new context associated with this container. All implicit model context operations in this view, such as Query properties, will use the environment’s context.
By default, the container stores its model data persistently on disk. To only store data in memory for the lifetime of the app’s process, pass true to the inMemory: parameter.
The container will only be created once. New values that are passed to the modelTypes and inMemory parameters after the view is first created will be ignored.
