Discussion
Use this modifier when you would like to add a fixed amount of space to the safe area a view sees.
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    HStack(spacing: 10.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            ItemView(item)
        }
    }
}
.safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, 20.0)
See the View/safeAreaInset(edge:alignment:spacing:content) modifier for adding to the safe area based on the size of a view.
