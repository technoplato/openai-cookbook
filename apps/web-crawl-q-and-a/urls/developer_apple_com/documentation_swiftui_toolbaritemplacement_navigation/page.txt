static let navigation: ToolbarItemPlacement
Discussion
Navigation actions allow the user to move between contexts. For example, the forward and back buttons of a web browser are navigation actions.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places navigation items in the leading edge of the toolbar ahead of the inline title if that is present in the toolbar.
In iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, navigation items appear in the leading edge of the navigation bar. If a system navigation item such as a back button is present in a compact width, it instead appears in the primaryAction placement.
