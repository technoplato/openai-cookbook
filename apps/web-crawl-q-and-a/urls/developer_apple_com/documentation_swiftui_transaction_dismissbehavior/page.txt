Discussion
The default value is .interactive.
You can use this property to dismiss windows which may be showing a modal presentation by using the .destructive value:
struct DismissWindowButton: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissWindow) private var dismissWindow


    var body: some View {
        Button("Close Auxiliary Window") {
            withTransaction(\.dismissBehavior, .destructive) {
                dismissWindow(id: "auxiliary")
            }
        }
    }
}
