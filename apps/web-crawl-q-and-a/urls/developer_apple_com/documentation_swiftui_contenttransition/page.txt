Structure
ContentTransition
A kind of transition that applies to the content within a single view, rather than to the insertion or removal of a view.

struct ContentTransition
Overview
Set the behavior of content transitions within a view with the contentTransition(_:) modifier, passing in one of the defined transitions, such as opacity or interpolate as the parameter.
Tip
Content transitions only take effect within transactions that apply an Animation to the views inside the contentTransition(_:) modifier.
Content transitions only take effect within the context of an Animation block.
Topics
Getting content transitions
static let identity: ContentTransition
The identity content transition, which indicates that content changes shouldn’t animate.
static let interpolate: ContentTransition
A content transition that indicates the views attempt to interpolate their contents during transitions, where appropriate.
static func numericText(countsDown: Bool) -> ContentTransition
Creates a content transition intended to be used with Text views displaying numeric text. In certain environments changes to the text will enable a nonstandard transition tailored to numeric characters that count up or down.
static func numericText(value: Double) -> ContentTransition
Creates a content transition intended to be used with Text views displaying numbers.
Beta
static let opacity: ContentTransition
A content transition that indicates content fades from transparent to opaque on insertion, and from opaque to transparent on removal.
static var symbolEffect: ContentTransition
A content transition that applies the default symbol effect transition to symbol images within the inserted or removed view hierarchy. Other views are unaffected by this transition.
Beta
static func symbolEffect<T>(T, options: SymbolEffectOptions) -> ContentTransition
Creates a content transition that applies the symbol Replace animation to symbol images that it is applied to.
