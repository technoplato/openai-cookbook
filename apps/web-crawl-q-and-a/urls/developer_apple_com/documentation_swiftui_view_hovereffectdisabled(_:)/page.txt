Instance Method
hoverEffectDisabled(_:)
Adds a condition that controls whether this view can display hover effects.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func hoverEffectDisabled(_ disabled: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
disabled
A Boolean value that determines whether this view can display hover effects.
Return Value
A view that controls whether hover effects can be displayed in this view.
Discussion
The higher views in a view hierarchy can override the value you set on this view. In the following example, the button does not display a hover effect because the outer hoverEffectDisabled(_:) modifier overrides the inner one:
HStack {
    Button("Press") {}
        .hoverEffectDisabled(false)
}
.hoverEffectDisabled(true)
