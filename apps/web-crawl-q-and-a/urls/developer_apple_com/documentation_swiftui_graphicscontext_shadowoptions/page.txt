struct ShadowOptions
Overview
You can use a set of these options when you call shadow(color:radius:x:y:blendMode:options:) to create a GraphicsContext.Filter that adds a drop shadow to an object that you draw into a GraphicsContext.
Topics
Getting shadow options
static var disablesGroup: GraphicsContext.ShadowOptions
An option that causes the filter to composite the object and its shadow separately in the current layer.
static var invertsAlpha: GraphicsContext.ShadowOptions
An option that causes the filter to invert the alpha of the shadow.
static var shadowAbove: GraphicsContext.ShadowOptions
An option that causes the filter to draw the shadow above the object, rather than below it.
static var shadowOnly: GraphicsContext.ShadowOptions
An option that causes the filter to draw only the shadow, and omit the source object.
