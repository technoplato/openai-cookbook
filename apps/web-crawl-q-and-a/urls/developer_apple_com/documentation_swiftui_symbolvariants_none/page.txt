static let none: SymbolVariants
Discussion
Using this variant with the symbolVariant(_:) modifier doesn’t have any effect. Instead, to show a symbol that ignores the current variant, directly set the symbolVariants environment value to none using the environment(_:_:) modifer:
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "heart")
    Image(systemName: "heart")
        .environment(\.symbolVariants, .none)
}
.symbolVariant(.fill)
