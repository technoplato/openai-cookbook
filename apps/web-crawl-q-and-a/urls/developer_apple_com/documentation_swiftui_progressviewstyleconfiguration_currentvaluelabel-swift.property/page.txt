var currentValueLabel: ProgressViewStyleConfiguration.CurrentValueLabel?
Discussion
If nil, then the value of the progress view is either self-evident from the surrounding context or unknown, and the style does not need to provide any additional description.
If the progress view is defined using a Progress instance, then this label is equivalent to its localizedAdditionalDescription.
