Creates a picker that generates its label from a string.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+

init<S>(
    _ title: S,
    selection: Binding<SelectionValue>,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> Content
) where S : StringProtocol
Available when Label is Text, SelectionValue conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
title
A string that describes the purpose of selecting an option.
selection
A binding to a property that determines the currently-selected option.
content
A view that contains the set of options.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the title similar to init(_:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a picker with a localized string key, use init(_:selection:content:) instead.
