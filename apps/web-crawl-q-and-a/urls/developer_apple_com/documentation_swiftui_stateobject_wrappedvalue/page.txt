var wrappedValue: ObjectType { get }
Discussion
The wrapped value property provides primary access to the value’s data. However, you don’t typically access it directly. Instead, SwiftUI accesses this property for you when you refer to the variable that you create with the @StateObject attribute:
@StateObject private var contact = Contact()


var body: some View {
    Text(contact.name) // Reads name from contact's wrapped value.
}
When you change a wrapped value, you can access the new value immediately. However, SwiftUI updates views that display the value asynchronously, so the interface might not update immediately.
