Initializer
init(sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:)
Creates a fetch request based on a predicate and value type sort parameters.
iOS 15.0+

@MainActor
init(
    sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor<Result>],
    predicate: NSPredicate? = nil,
    animation: Animation? = nil
)
Available when Result inherits NSManagedObject.
Parameters
sortDescriptors
An array of sort descriptors that define the sort order of the fetched results.
predicate
An NSPredicate instance that defines logical conditions used to filter the fetched results.
animation
The animation to use for user interface changes that result from changes to the fetched results.
Discussion
The request gets the entity type from the Result instance by calling that managed object’s entity() type method. If you need to specify the entity type explicitly, use the init(entity:sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:) initializer instead. If you need more control over the fetch request configuration, use init(fetchRequest:animation:). For reference type sort descriptors, use init(sortDescriptors:predicate:animation:).
