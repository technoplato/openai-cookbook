Type Method
easeOut(duration:)
An animation with a specified duration that starts quickly and then slows towards the end of the movement.

static func easeOut(duration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
Parameters
duration
The length of time, expressed in seconds, that the animation takes to complete.
Return Value
An ease-out animation with a specified duration.
Discussion
An easing animation provides motion with a natural feel by varying the acceleration and deceleration of the animation, which matches how things tend to move in reality. With an ease out animation, the motion starts quickly and decreases its speed towards the end.
Use easeOut(duration:) when you want to specify the time it takes for the animation to complete. Otherwise, use easeOut to perform the animation for a default length of time.
The following code shows an example of animating the size changes of a Circle using an ease out animation with a duration of one second.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 0.5


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .scale(scale)
                .animation(.easeOut(duration: 1.0), value: scale)
            HStack {
                Button("+") { scale += 0.1 }
                Button("-") { scale -= 0.1 }
            }
        }
    }
}
