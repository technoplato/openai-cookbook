A WatchKit interface controller that hosts a SwiftUI view hierarchy.
watchOS 6.0+
@MainActor
class WKHostingController<Body> where Body : View
Overview
A WKHostingController presents and manages your app’s main interface using SwiftUI views. You must subclass WKHostingController and override the body property to provide the set of SwiftUI views you want to display. Display the content of your hosting controller as you would any other WKInterfaceController object. For example, you can include it as one of your app’s root interface controllers, or present it modally.
