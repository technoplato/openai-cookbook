static var automatic: ToolbarTitleDisplayMode { get }
Discussion
For root content in a navigation stack in iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS this behavior will:
Default to large when a navigation title is configured.
Default to inline when no navigation title is provided.
In all platforms, content pushed onto a navigation stack will use the behavior of the content already on the navigation stack. This has no effect in macOS.
