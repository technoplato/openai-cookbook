struct Shader
Overview
Shader values can be used as filter effects on views, see the View/colorEffect(_:isEnabled:)`, View/distortionEffect(_:isEnabled:), and ``View/layerEffect(_:isEnabled:) functions.
Shaders also conform to the ShapeStyle protocol, letting their MSL shader function provide per-pixel color to fill any shape or text view. For a shader function to act as a fill pattern it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the pixel applied to the shader, and args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader. The function should return the premultiplied color value in the color space of the destination (typically extended sRGB).
Topics
Creating a shader
init(function: ShaderFunction, arguments: [Shader.Argument])
Creates a new shader from a function and the uniform argument values to bind to the function.
struct Argument
A single uniform argument value to a shader function.
Getting the shader function
var function: ShaderFunction
The shader function called by the shader.
var arguments: [Shader.Argument]
The uniform argument values passed to the shader function.
Configuring the shader
var dithersColor: Bool
For shader functions that return color values, whether the returned color has dither noise added to it, or is simply rounded to the output bit-depth. For shaders generating smooth gradients, dithering is usually necessary to prevent visible banding in the result.

func distortionEffect(Shader, maxSampleOffset: CGSize, isEnabled: Bool) -> some View
Returns a new view that applies shader to self as a geometric distortion effect on the location of each pixel.
Beta
func layerEffect(Shader, maxSampleOffset: CGSize, isEnabled: Bool) -> some View
