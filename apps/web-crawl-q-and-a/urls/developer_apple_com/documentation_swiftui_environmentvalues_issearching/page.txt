Instance Property
isSearching
A Boolean value that indicates when the user is searching.

var isSearching: Bool { get }
Discussion
You can read this value like any of the other EnvironmentValues, by creating a property with the Environment property wrapper:
@Environment(\.isSearching) private var isSearching
Get the value to find out when the user interacts with a search field that’s produced by one of the searchable modifiers, like searchable(text:placement:prompt:):
struct SearchingExample: View {
    @State private var searchText = ""


    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            SearchedView()
                .searchable(text: $searchText)
        }
    }
}


struct SearchedView: View {
    @Environment(\.isSearching) private var isSearching


    var body: some View {
        Text(isSearching ? "Searching!" : "Not searching.")
    }
}
When the user first taps or clicks in a search field, the isSearching property becomes true. When the user cancels the search operation, the property becomes false. To programmatically set the value to false and dismiss the search operation, use dismissSearch.
Important
Access the value from inside the searched view, as the example above demonstrates, rather than from the searched view’s parent. SwiftUI sets the value in the environment of the view that you apply the searchable modifier to, and doesn’t propagate the value up the view hierarchy.
