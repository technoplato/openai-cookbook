func textInputAutocapitalization(_ autocapitalization: TextInputAutocapitalization?) -> some View
Parameters
autocapitalization
One of the capitalizing behaviors defined in the TextInputAutocapitalization struct or nil.
Discussion
Use textInputAutocapitalization(_:) when you need to automatically capitalize words, sentences, or other text like proper nouns.
In example below, as the user enters text the shift key is automatically enabled before every word:
TextField("Last, First", text: $fullName)
    .textInputAutocapitalization(.words)
The TextInputAutocapitalization struct defines the available autocapitalizing behavior. Providing nil to this view modifier does not change the autocapitalization behavior. The default is TextInputAutocapitalization.sentences.
