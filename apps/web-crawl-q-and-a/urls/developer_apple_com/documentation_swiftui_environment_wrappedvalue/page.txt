var wrappedValue: Value { get }
Discussion
The wrapped value property provides primary access to the value’s data. However, you don’t access wrappedValue directly. Instead, you read the property variable created with the Environment property wrapper:
@Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme: ColorScheme


var body: some View {
    if colorScheme == .dark {
        DarkContent()
    } else {
        LightContent()
    }
}
