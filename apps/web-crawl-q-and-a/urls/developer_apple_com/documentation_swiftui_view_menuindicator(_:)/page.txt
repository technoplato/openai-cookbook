func menuIndicator(_ visibility: Visibility) -> some View
Parameters
visibility
The menu indicator visibility to apply.
Discussion
Use this modifier to override the default menu indicator visibility for controls in this view. For example, the code below creates a menu without an indicator:
Menu {
    ForEach(history , id: \.self) { historyItem in
        Button(historyItem.title) {
            self.openURL(historyItem.url)
        }
    }
} label: {
    Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
        .labelStyle(.iconOnly)
} primaryAction: {
    if let last = history.last {
        self.openURL(last.url)
    }
}
.menuIndicator(.hidden)
Note
On tvOS, the standard button styles do not include a menu indicator, so this modifier will have no effect when using a built-in button style. You can implement an indicator in your own ButtonStyle implementation by checking the value of the menuIndicatorVisibility environment value.
