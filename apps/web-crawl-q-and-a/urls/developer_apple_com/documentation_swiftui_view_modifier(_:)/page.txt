Discussion
Use this modifier to combine a View and a ViewModifier, to create a new view. For example, if you create a view modifier for a new kind of caption with blue text surrounded by a rounded rectangle:
struct BorderedCaption: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .font(.caption2)
            .padding(10)
            .overlay(
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 15)
                    .stroke(lineWidth: 1)
            )
            .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
    }
}
You can use modifier(_:) to extend View to create new modifier for applying the BorderedCaption defined above:
extension View {
    func borderedCaption() -> some View {
        modifier(BorderedCaption())
    }
}
Then you can apply the bordered caption to any view:
Image(systemName: "bus")
    .resizable()
    .frame(width:50, height:50)
Text("Downtown Bus")
    .borderedCaption()
