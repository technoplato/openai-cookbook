Instance Property
multilineTextAlignment
An environment value that indicates how a text view aligns its lines when the content wraps or contains newlines.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var multilineTextAlignment: TextAlignment { get set }
Discussion
Set this value for a view hierarchy by applying the multilineTextAlignment(_:) view modifier. Views in the hierarchy that display text, like Text or TextEditor, read the value from the environment and adjust their text alignment accordingly.
This value has no effect on a Text view that contains only one line of text, because a text view has a width that exactly matches the width of its widest line. If you want to align an entire text view rather than its contents, set the aligment of its container, like a VStack or a frame that you create with the frame(minWidth:idealWidth:maxWidth:minHeight:idealHeight:maxHeight:alignment:) modifier.
Note
You can use this value to control the alignment of a Text view that you create with the init(_:style:) initializer to display localized dates and times, including when the view uses only a single line, but only when that view appears in a widget.
