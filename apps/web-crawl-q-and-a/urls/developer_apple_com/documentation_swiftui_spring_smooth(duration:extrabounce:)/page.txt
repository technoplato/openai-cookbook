Type Method
smooth(duration:extraBounce:)
A smooth spring with a predefined duration and no bounce that can be tuned.

static func smooth(
    duration: TimeInterval = 0.5,
    extraBounce: Double = 0.0
) -> Spring
Parameters
duration
The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring. This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for very bouncy springs, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.
extraBounce
How much additional bounce should be added to the base bounce of 0.
