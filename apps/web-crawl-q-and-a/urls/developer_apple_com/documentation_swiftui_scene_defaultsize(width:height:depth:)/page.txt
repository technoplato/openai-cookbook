func defaultSize(
    width: CGFloat,
    height: CGFloat,
    depth: CGFloat
) -> some Scene
Parameters
width
The default width for the created window.
height
The default height for the created window.
depth
The default depth for the created volumetric window.
Return Value
A scene that uses a default size for new windows.
Discussion
Use this modifier to indicate the default initial size for a new 3D window created from a Scene using VolumetricWindowStyle:
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
}
.windowStyle(.volumetric)
.defaultSize(width: 600, height: 400, depth: 600)
Each parameter is specified in points. The size of a volumetric scene is immutable after creation.
This modifier affects only windows that have the volumetric style in visionOS.
