Instance Method
addRelativeArc(center:radius:startAngle:delta:transform:)
Adds an arc of a circle to the path, specified with a radius and a difference in angle.

mutating func addRelativeArc(
    center: CGPoint,
    radius: CGFloat,
    startAngle: Angle,
    delta: Angle,
    transform: CGAffineTransform = .identity
)
Parameters
center
The center of the arc, in user space coordinates.
radius
The radius of the arc, in user space coordinates.
startAngle
The angle to the starting point of the arc, measured from the positive x-axis.
delta
The difference between the starting angle and ending angle of the arc. A positive value creates a counter- clockwise arc (in user space coordinates), and vice versa.
transform
An affine transform to apply to the arc before adding to the path. Defaults to the identity transform if not specified. /
Discussion
This method calculates starting and ending points using the radius and angles you specify, uses a sequence of cubic Bézier curves to approximate a segment of a circle between those points, and then appends those curves to the path.
The delta parameter determines both the length of the arc the direction in which the arc is created; the actual direction of the final path is dependent on the transform parameter and the current transform of a context where the path is drawn. However, because SwiftUI by default uses a vertically-flipped coordinate system (with the origin in the top-left of the view), specifying a clockwise arc results in a counterclockwise arc after the transformation is applied.
If the path ends with an unclosed subpath, this method adds a line connecting the current point to the starting point of the arc. If there is no unclosed subpath, this method creates a new subpath whose starting point is the starting point of the arc. The ending point of the arc becomes the new current point of the path.
