    design: Font.Design? = nil
) -> Font
Discussion
Use this function to create a system font by specifying the size and weight, and a type design together. The following styles the system font as 17 point, semibold text:
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, weight: .semibold))
While the following styles the text as 17 point bold, and applies a serif Font.Design to the system font:
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, weight: .bold, design: .serif))
Both weight and design can be optional. When you do not provide a weight or design, the system can pick one based on the current context, which may not be regular or Font.Design.default in certain context. The following example styles the text as 17 point system font using Font.Design.rounded design, while its weight can depend on the current context:
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 17, design: .rounded))
