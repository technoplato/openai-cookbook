Instance Method
velocity(value:time:context:)
Calculates the velocity of the animation at a specified time.
iOS 17.0+ Beta

func velocity<V>(
    value: V,
    time: TimeInterval,
    context: AnimationContext<V>
) -> V? where V : VectorArithmetic
Required Default implementation provided.
Parameters
value
The vector to animate towards.
time
The amount of time since the start of the animation.
context
An instance of AnimationContext that provides access to state and the animation environment.
Return Value
The current velocity of the animation, or nil if the animation has finished.
Discussion
Implement this method to provide the velocity of the animation at a given time. Should subsequent animations merge with the animation, the system preserves continuity of the velocity between animations.
The default implementation of this method returns nil.
Note
State and environment data is available to this method via the context parameter, but context is read-only. This behavior is different than with animate(value:time:context:) and shouldMerge(previous:value:time:context:) where context is an inout parameter, letting you change the context including state data of the animation. For more information about managing state data in a custom animation, see AnimationContext.
Default Implementations
CustomAnimation Implementations
func velocity<V>(value: V, time: TimeInterval, context: AnimationContext<V>) -> V?
Calculates the velocity of the animation at a specified time.
Beta Software
This documentation contains preliminary information about an API or technology in development. This information is subject to change, and software implemented according to this documentation should be tested with final operating system software.
