A gauge style that displays a bar with a marker that appears at a point along the bar to indicate the gauge’s current value.
watchOS 7.0+
static var linear: LinearGaugeStyle { get }

Discussion
Apply this style to a Gauge or to a view hierarchy that contains gauges using the gaugeStyle(_:) modifier:
Gauge(value: batteryLevel, in: 0...100) {
    Text("Battery Level")
}
.gaugeStyle(.linear)
If you provide minimumValueLabel and maximumValueLabel parameters when you create the gauge, they appear on leading and trailing edges of the bar, respectively. Otherwise, the gauge displays the currentValueLabel value on the leading edge.
