func scrollIndicatorsFlash(trigger value: some Equatable) -> some View
Parameters
value
The value that causes scroll indicators to flash. The value must conform to the Equatable protocol.
Return Value
A view that flashes any visible scroll indicators when a value changes.
Discussion
When the value that you provide to this modifier changes, the scroll indicators of any scrollable views within the modified view hierarchy briefly flash. The following example configures the scroll indicators to flash any time flashCount changes:
@State private var isPresented = false
@State private var flashCount = 0


ScrollView {
    // ...
}
.scrollIndicatorsFlash(trigger: flashCount)
.sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {
    // ...
}
.onChange(of: isPresented) { newValue in
    if newValue {
        flashCount += 1
    }
}
Only scroll indicators that you configure to be visible flash. To flash scroll indicators when a scroll view initially appears, use scrollIndicatorsFlash(onAppear:) instead.
