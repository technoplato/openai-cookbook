var nsSortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor] { get nonmutating set }
Discussion
Set this value to cause the associated SectionedFetchRequest to execute a fetch with a new collection of NSSortDescriptor instances. The order of managed objects stored in the results collection may change as a result. Use care to coordinate section and sort updates, as described in SectionedFetchRequest.Configuration.
If you want to use SortDescriptor instances, set sortDescriptors instead.
