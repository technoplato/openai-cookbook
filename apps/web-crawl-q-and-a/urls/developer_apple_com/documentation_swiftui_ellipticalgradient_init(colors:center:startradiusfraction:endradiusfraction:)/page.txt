Discussion
For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the top-leading corner of the view:
EllipticalGradient(
    colors: [.blue, .green],
    center: .topLeading,
    startRadiusFraction: 0,
    endRadiusFraction: 1)
colors: The colors, evenly distributed throughout the gradient.
center: The center of the circle, in [0, 1] coordinates.
startRadiusFraction: The start radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
endRadiusFraction: The end radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
