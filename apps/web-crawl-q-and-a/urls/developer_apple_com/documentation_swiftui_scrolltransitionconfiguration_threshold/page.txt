Topics
Getting the threshold
static var centered: ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
The target view is centered within the container
static let hidden: ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
static let visible: ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
static func visible(Double) -> ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
The target view is visible by the given amount, where zero is fully hidden, and one is fully visible.
Modifying the threshold
func inset(by: Double) -> ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
Returns a threshold that is met when the target view is closer to the center of the container by distance. Use negative values to move the threshold away from the center.
func interpolated(towards: ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold, amount: Double) -> ScrollTransitionConfiguration.Threshold
Creates a new threshold that combines this threshold value with another threshold, interpolated by the given amount.
