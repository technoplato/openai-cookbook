Deprecated
Use mask(alignment:_:) instead.
Parameters
mask
The view whose alpha the rendering system applies to the specified view.

Use mask(_:) when you want to apply the alpha (opacity) value of another view to the current view.
This example shows an image masked by rectangle with a 10% opacity:
Image(systemName: "envelope.badge.fill")
    .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
    .font(.system(size: 128, weight: .regular))
    .mask(Rectangle().opacity(0.1))
