Swift
Instance Method
background(in:fillStyle:)
Sets the view’s background to an insettable shape filled with the default background style.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func background<S>(
    in shape: S,
    fillStyle: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : InsettableShape
Parameters
shape
An instance of a type that conforms to InsettableShape that SwiftUI draws behind the view using the background shape style.
fillStyle
The FillStyle to use when drawing the shape. The default style uses the nonzero winding number rule and antialiasing.
Return Value
A view with the specified insettable shape drawn behind it.
Discussion
This modifier behaves like background(_:in:fillStyle:), except that it always uses the background shape style to fill the specified insettable shape. For example, you can use a RoundedRectangle as a background on a Label:
ZStack {
    Color.teal
    Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
        .padding()
        .background(in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
}
Without the background modifier, the fill color shows through the label. With the modifier, the label’s text and icon appear backed by a shape filled with a color that’s appropriate for light or dark appearance:
To create a background with other View types — or with a stack of views — use background(alignment:content:) instead. To add a ShapeStyle as a background, use background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:).
