func interactionActivityTrackingTag(_ tag: String) -> some View
Parameters
tag
The tag used to track user interactions hosted by this view as activities.
Return Value
A view that uses a tracking tag.
Discussion
The following example tracks the scrolling activity of a List:
List {
    Section("Today") {
        ForEach(messageStore.today) { message in
            Text(message.title)
        }
    }
}
.interactionActivityTrackingTag("MessagesList")
The resolved activity tracking tag is additive, so using the modifier across the view hierarchy builds the tag from top to bottom. The example below shows a hierarchical usage of this modifier with the resulting tag Home-Feed:
var body: some View {
    Home()
        .interactionActivityTrackingTag("Home")
}


struct Home: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Text("A List Item")
            Text("A Second List Item")
            Text("A Third List Item")
        }
        .interactionActivityTrackingTag("Feed")
    }
}
