func lineLimit(_ number: Int?) -> some View
Parameters
number
The line limit. If nil, no line limit applies.
Return Value
A view that limits the number of lines that Text instances display.
Discussion
Use this modifier to cap the number of lines that an individual text element can display.
The line limit applies to all Text instances within a hierarchy. For example, an HStack with multiple pieces of text longer than three lines caps each piece of text to three lines rather than capping the total number of lines across the HStack.
In the example below, the modifier limits the very long line in the Text element to the 2 lines that fit within the view’s bounds:
Text("This is a long string that demonstrates the effect of SwiftUI's lineLimit(:_) operator.")
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200, alignment: .leading)
    .lineLimit(2)
