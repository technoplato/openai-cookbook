Discussion
For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the top-leading corner of the view:
EllipticalGradient(
    gradient: .init(colors: [.blue, .green]),
    center: .topLeading,
    startRadiusFraction: 0,
    endRadiusFraction: 1)
gradient: The colors and their parametric locations.
center: The center of the circle, in [0, 1] coordinates.
startRadiusFraction: The start radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
endRadiusFraction: The end radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
