Instance Method
accessibilityDirectTouch(_:options:)
Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.

func accessibilityDirectTouch(
    _ isDirectTouchArea: Bool = true,
    options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions = []
) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Discussion
For example, this is how a direct touch area would allow a VoiceOver user to interact with a view with a rotationEffect controlled by a RotationGesture. The direct touch area would require a user to activate the area before using the direct touch area.
var body: some View {
    Rectangle()
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200, alignment: .center)
        .rotationEffect(angle)
        .gesture(rotation)
        .accessibilityDirectTouch(options: .requiresActivation)
}
