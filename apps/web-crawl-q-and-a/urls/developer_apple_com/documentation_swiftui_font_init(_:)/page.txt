init(_ font: CTFont)
Discussion
Initializing Font with platform font instance (CTFont) can bridge SwiftUI Font with NSFont or UIFont, both of which are toll-free bridged to CTFont. For example:
// Use native Core Text API to create desired ctFont.
let ctFont = CTFontCreateUIFontForLanguage(.system, 12, nil)!


// Create SwiftUI Text with the CTFont instance.
let text = Text("Hello").font(Font(ctFont))
