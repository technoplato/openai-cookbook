Instance Property
sceneBridgingOptions
The options for which aspects of the window will be managed by this hosting view.
macOS 14.0+ Beta
@MainActor
var sceneBridgingOptions: NSHostingSceneBridgingOptions { get set }
Discussion
NSHostingView will populate certain aspects of its associated window, depending on which options are specified.
For example, a hosting view can manage its window’s toolbar by including the .toolbars option:
struct RootView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ContentView()
            .toolbar {
                MyToolbarContent()
            }
    }
}


let view = NSHostingView(rootView: RootView())
view.sceneBridgingOptions = [.toolbars]
When this hosting view is set as the contentView for a window, the default value for this property will be .all, which includes the options for .toolbars and .title. Otherwise, the default value is [].
