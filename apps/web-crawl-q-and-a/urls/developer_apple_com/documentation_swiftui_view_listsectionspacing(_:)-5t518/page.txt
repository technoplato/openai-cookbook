func listSectionSpacing(_ spacing: ListSectionSpacing) -> some View
Discussion
Pass .default for the default spacing, or use .compact for a compact appearance between sections.
The following example creates a List with compact spacing between sections:
List {
    Section("Colors") {
        Text("Blue")
        Text("Red")
    }


    Section("Shapes") {
        Text("Square")
        Text("Circle")
    }
}
.listSectionSpacing(.compact)
