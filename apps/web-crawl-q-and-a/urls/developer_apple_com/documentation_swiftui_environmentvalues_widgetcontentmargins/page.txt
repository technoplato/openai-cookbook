var widgetContentMargins: EdgeInsets { get }
Return Value
Returns the content margins for the current widget presentation context.
Discussion
The content margins of a widget depend on the context in which it appears. The system applies default content margins. However, if you disable automatic application of default content margins with contentMarginsDisabled(), the system uses the widgetContentMargins property in combination with View/padding(_) to selectively apply default content margins.
