Instance Method
scenePadding(_:)
Adds padding to the specified edges of this view using an amount that’s appropriate for the current scene.

func scenePadding(_ edges: Edge.Set = .all) -> some View
Parameters
edges
The set of edges along which to pad this view.
Return Value
A view that’s padded on specified edges by a scene-appropriate amount.
Discussion
Use this modifier to add a scene-appropriate amount of padding to a view. Specify either a single edge value from Edge.Set, or an OptionSet that describes the edges to pad.
In macOS, use scene padding to produce the recommended spacing around the root view of a window. In watchOS, use scene padding to align elements of your user interface with top level elements, like the title of a navigation view. For example, compare the effects of different kinds of padding on text views presented inside a NavigationView in watchOS:
VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 10) {
    Text("Scene padding")
        .scenePadding(.horizontal)
        .border(.red) // Border added for reference.
    Text("Regular padding")
        .padding(.horizontal)
        .border(.green)
    Text("Text with no padding")
        .border(.blue)
    Button("Button") { }
}
.navigationTitle("Hello World")
The text with scene padding automatically aligns with the title, unlike the text that uses the default padding or the text without padding:
Scene padding in watchOS also ensures that your content avoids the curved edges of a device like Apple Watch Series 7. In other platforms, scene padding produces the same default padding that you get from the padding(_:_:) modifier.
Important
Scene padding doesn’t pad the top and bottom edges of a view in watchOS, even if you specify those edges as part of the input. For example, if you specify vertical instead of horizontal in the example above, the modifier would have no effect in watchOS. It does, however, apply to all the edges that you specify in other platforms.
