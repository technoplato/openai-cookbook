Initializer
init(_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)
Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<F>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    value: Binding<F.FormatInput>,
    in bounds: ClosedRange<F.FormatInput>,
    step: F.FormatInput.Stride = 1,
    format: F,
    onEditingChanged: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
) where F : ParseableFormatStyle, F.FormatInput : BinaryFloatingPoint, F.FormatOutput == String
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the stepper’s localized title describing the purpose of the stepper.
value
A Binding to a value that your provide.
bounds
A closed range that describes the upper and lower bounds permitted by the stepper.
step
The amount to increment or decrement value each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement button, respectively. Defaults to 1.
format
A format style of type F to use when converting between the string the user edits and the underlying value of type F.FormatInput. If format can’t perform the conversion, the stepper leaves value unchanged. If the user stops editing the text in an invalid state, the stepper updates the text to the last known valid value.
onEditingChanged
A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a Stepper which causes the execution of the onEditingChanged closure at the start and end of the gesture.
Discussion
Use Stepper(_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:) to create a stepper that increments or decrements a value within a specific range of values by a specific step size, while displaying the current value. In the example below, a stepper increments or decrements a binding to value over a range of 1...50 by 5 each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons:
struct StepperView: View {
    @State private var value = 0


    var body: some View {
        Stepper("Stepping by \(step) in \(range.description)",
            value: $value,
            in: 1...50,
            step: 5,
            format: .number
        )
        .padding()
    }
}
