Overview
Different views can support customizating margins that appear in different parts of that view. Use values of this type to customize those margins of a particular placement.
For example, use a scrollIndicators placement to customize the margins of scrollable view’s scroll indicators separately from the margins of a scrollable view’s content.
Use this type in conjunction with the View/contentMargin(_:for:) modifier.
