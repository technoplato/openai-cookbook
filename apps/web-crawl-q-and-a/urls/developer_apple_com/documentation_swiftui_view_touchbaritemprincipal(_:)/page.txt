Instance Method
touchBarItemPrincipal(_:)
Sets principal views that have special significance to this Touch Bar.
macOS 10.15+
func touchBarItemPrincipal(_ principal: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
principal
A Boolean value that indicates whether to display this view prominently in the Touch Bar compared to other views.
Return Value
A Touch Bar view with one element centered in the Touch Bar row.
Discussion
Use touchBarItemPrincipal(_:) to designate a view as a significant view in the Touch Bar. Currently, that view will be placed in the center of the row.
The example below sets the last button as the principal button for the Touch Bar view.
let touchBarItems = TouchBar(id: "myBarItems") {
    Button("♣️", action: {})
    Button("♥️", action: {})
    Button("♠️", action: {})
    Button("♦️", action: {})
       .touchBarItemPrincipal(true)
}


TextField("TouchBar Demo", text: $placeholder)
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
    .focusable()
    .touchBar(touchBarItems)
Note
Multiple visible bars may each specify a principal view, but the system only honors one of them.
