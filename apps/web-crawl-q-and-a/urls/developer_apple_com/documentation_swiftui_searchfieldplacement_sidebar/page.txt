static let sidebar: SearchFieldPlacement
Discussion
The precise placement depends on the platform:
In iOS and iPadOS the search field appears in the section of the navigation bar associated with the sidebar.
In macOS, the search field appears inline with the sidebar’s content.
If a sidebar isn’t available, like when you apply the searchable modifier to a view other than a navigation split view, SwiftUI uses automatic placement instead.
