Initializer
init(_:content:)
Creates an instance that computes table rows on demand over a given constant range.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<V>(
    _ data: Range<Int>,
    @TableRowBuilder<V> content: @escaping (Int) -> Content
) where Data == Range<Int>, ID == Int, V == Content.TableRowValue
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to TableRowContent.
Parameters
data
A constant range.
content
The table row builder that creates rows dynamically.
Discussion
The instance only reads the initial value of the provided data and doesn’t need to identify rows across updates. To compute rows on demand over a dynamic range, use ForEach/init(_:id:content:).

init<V>(Data, content: (Data.Element) -> Content)
Creates an instance that uniquely identifies and creates table rows across updates based on the identity of the underlying data.
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to TableRowContent.
init<V>(Data, id: KeyPath<Data.Element, ID>, content: (Data.Element) -> Content)
Creates an instance that uniquely identifies and creates table rows across updates based on the provided key path to the underlying data’s identifier.
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to TableRowContent.
