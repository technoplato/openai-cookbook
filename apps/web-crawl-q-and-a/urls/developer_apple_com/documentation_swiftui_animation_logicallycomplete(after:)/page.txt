func logicallyComplete(after duration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
Parameters
duration
The duration after which the animation should report that it is logically complete.
Return Value
An animation that reports logical completion after the given duration.
Discussion
Note that the indicated duration will not cause the animation to continue running after the base animation has fully completed.
If the animation is removed before the given duration is reached, logical completion will be reported immediately.
