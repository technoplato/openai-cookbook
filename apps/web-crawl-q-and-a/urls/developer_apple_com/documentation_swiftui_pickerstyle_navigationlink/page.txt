static var navigationLink: NavigationLinkPickerStyle { get }
Available when Self is NavigationLinkPickerStyle.
Discussion
In navigation stacks, prefer the default menu style. Consider the navigation link style when you have a large number of options or your design is better expressed by pushing onto a stack.
To apply this style to a picker, or to a view that contains pickers, use the pickerStyle(_:) modifier.
