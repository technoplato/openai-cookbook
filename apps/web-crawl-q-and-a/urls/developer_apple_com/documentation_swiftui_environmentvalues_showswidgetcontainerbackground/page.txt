Instance Property
showsWidgetContainerBackground
An environment variable that indicates whether the background of a widget appears.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@_backDeploy(before: iOS 17.0, watchOS 10.0, macOS 14.0)
var showsWidgetContainerBackground: Bool { get }
Return Value
true if, by default, the background appears in this context; false otherwise.
Discussion
In iOS 16 and earlier, this environment variable is always true for system widgets and false for accessory widgets. In macOS 13 and earlier, and in watchOS 9 and earlier, it always evaluates to true.
If you pass false to containerBackgroundRemovable(_:) to always show the widget background, the system shows the widget background even if showsWidgetContainerBackground evaluates to true.
