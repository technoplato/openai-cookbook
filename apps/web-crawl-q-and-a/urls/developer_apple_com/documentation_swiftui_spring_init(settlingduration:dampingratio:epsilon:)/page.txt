Parameters
settlingDuration
The approximate time it will take for the spring to come to rest.
dampingRatio
The amount of drag applied as a fraction of the amount needed to produce critical damping.
epsilon
The threshhold for how small all subsequent values need to be before the spring is considered to have settled.
