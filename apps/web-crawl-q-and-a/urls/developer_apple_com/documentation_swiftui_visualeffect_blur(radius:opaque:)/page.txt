func blur(
    radius: CGFloat,
    opaque: Bool = false
) -> some VisualEffect
Parameters
radius
The radial size of the blur. A blur is more diffuse when its radius is large.
opaque
A Boolean value that indicates whether the blur renderer permits transparency in the blur output. Set to true to create an opaque blur, or set to false to permit transparency.
Return Value
An effect that blurs the view.
Discussion
Use blur(radius:opaque:) to apply a gaussian blur effect to the rendering of the view.
