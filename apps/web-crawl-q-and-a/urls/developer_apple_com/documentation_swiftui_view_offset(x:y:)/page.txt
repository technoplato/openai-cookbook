func offset(
    x: CGFloat = 0,
    y: CGFloat = 0
) -> some View
Parameters
x
The horizontal distance to offset this view.
y
The vertical distance to offset this view.
Return Value
A view that offsets this view by x and y.
Discussion
Use offset(x:y:) to shift the displayed contents by the amount specified in the x and y parameters.
The original dimensions of the view aren’t changed by offsetting the contents; in the example below the gray border drawn by this view surrounds the original position of the text:
Text("Offset by passing horizontal & vertical distance")
    .border(Color.green)
    .offset(x: 20, y: 50)
    .border(Color.gray)
