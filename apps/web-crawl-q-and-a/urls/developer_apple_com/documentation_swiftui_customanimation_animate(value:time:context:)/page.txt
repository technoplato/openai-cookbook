Instance Method

func animate<V>(
    value: V,
    time: TimeInterval,
    context: inout AnimationContext<V>
) -> V? where V : VectorArithmetic
Required
Parameters
value
The vector to animate towards.
time
The elapsed time since the start of the animation.
context
An instance of AnimationContext that provides access to state and the animation environment.
Return Value
The current value of the animation, or nil if the animation has finished.
Discussion
Implement this method to calculate and return the value of the animation at a given point in time. If the animation has finished, return nil as the value. This signals to the system that it can remove the animation.
If your custom animation needs to maintain state between calls to the animate(value:time:context:) method, store the state data in context. This makes the data available to the method next time the system calls it. To learn more about managing state data in a custom animation, see AnimationContext.
