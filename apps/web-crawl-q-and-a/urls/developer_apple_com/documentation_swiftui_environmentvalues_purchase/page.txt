Discussion
Read this environment value to get an PurchaseAction instance for a given Environment. Call the instance to start an in-app purchase. You call the instance directly because it defines a PurchaseAction/callAsFunction(_:options:) method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can start an in-app purchase when the user taps a button:
struct PurchaseExample: View {
    @Environment(\.purchase) private var purchase
    let product: Product
    let purchaseOptions: [Product.PurchaseOption]


    var body: some View {
        Button {
            Task {
                let purchaseResult = try? await purchase(product, options: purchaseOptions)
                // Process purchase result.
            }
        } label: {
            Text(product.displayName)
        }
    }
}
