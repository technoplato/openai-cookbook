Discussion
This level of prominence should be used for badges that display a value that requires user action, such as number of updates or account errors.
In lists on iOS and macOS, this results in badge labels being displayed on a red platter.
ForEach(accounts) { account in
    Text(account.userName)
        .badge(account.setupErrors)
        .badgeProminence(.increased)
}
