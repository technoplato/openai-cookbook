Swift
Instance Method
onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)
Adds an action to perform when the pointer enters, moves within, and exits the view’s bounds.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func onContinuousHover(
    coordinateSpace: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol = .local,
    perform action: @escaping (HoverPhase) -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
coordinateSpace
The coordinate space for the location values. Defaults to CoordinateSpace.local.
action
The action to perform whenever the pointer enters, moves within, or exits the view’s bounds. The action closure passes the HoverPhase.active(_:) phase with the pointer’s coordinates if the pointer is in the view’s bounds; otherwise, it passes HoverPhase.ended.
Return Value
A view that calls action when the pointer enters, moves within, or exits the view’s bounds.
Discussion
Call this method to define a region for detecting pointer movement with the size and position of this view. The following example updates hoverLocation and isHovering to be based on the phase provided to the closure:
@State private var hoverLocation: CGPoint = .zero
@State private var isHovering = false


var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Color.red
            .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
            .onContinuousHover { phase in
                switch phase {
                case .active(let location):
                    hoverLocation = location
                    isHovering = true
                case .ended:
                    isHovering = false
                }
            }
            .overlay {
                Rectangle()
                    .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
                    .foregroundColor(isHovering ? .green : .blue)
                    .offset(x: hoverLocation.x, y: hoverLocation.y)
            }
    }
}
