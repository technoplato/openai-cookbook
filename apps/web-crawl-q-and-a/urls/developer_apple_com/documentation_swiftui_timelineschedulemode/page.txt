enum TimelineScheduleMode
Overview
A TimelineView provides a mode when calling its schedule’s entries(from:mode:) method. The view chooses a mode based on the state of the system. For example, a watchOS view might request a lower frequency of updates, using the TimelineScheduleMode.lowFrequency mode, when the user lowers their wrist.
