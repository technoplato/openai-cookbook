Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates an environment property to read an observable object from the environment, returning nil if no corresponding object has been set in the current view’s environment.

init<T>(_ objectType: T.Type) where Value == T?, T : AnyObject, T : Observable
Parameters
objectType
The type of the Observable object to read from the environment.
Discussion
Important
This initializer only accepts objects conforming to the Observable protocol. For reading environment objects that conform to ObservableObject, use EnvironmentObject instead.
Don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, declare an optional property with the Environment property wrapper, passing the object’s type to the wrapper:
@Observable final class Profile { ... }


struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(Profile.self) private var currentProfile: Profile?


    // ...
}
If no object has been set in the view’s environment, this property will return nil as its wrapped value.
SwiftUI automatically updates any parts of MyView that depend on the property when the associated environment object changes.
You can’t modify the environment object using a property like this. Instead, use the View/environment(_:)-9b2sq view modifier on a view to set an object for a view hierarchy.
