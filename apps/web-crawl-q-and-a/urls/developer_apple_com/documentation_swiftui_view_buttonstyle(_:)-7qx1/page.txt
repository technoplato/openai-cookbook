func buttonStyle<S>(_ style: S) -> some View where S : ButtonStyle
Discussion
Use this modifier to set a specific style for all button instances within a view:
HStack {
    Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
    Button("Register", action: register)
}
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
You can also use this modifier to set the style for controls with a button style through composition:
VStack {
    Menu("Terms and Conditions") {
        Button("Open in Preview", action: openInPreview)
        Button("Save as PDF", action: saveAsPDF)
    }
    Toggle("Remember Password", isOn: $isToggleOn)
    Toggle("Flag", isOn: $flagged)
    Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
}
.menuStyle(.button)
.toggleStyle(.button)
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
In this example, .menuStyle(.button) says that the Terms and Conditions menu renders as a button, while .toggleStyle(.button) says that the two toggles also render as buttons. Finally, .buttonStyle(.bordered) says that the menu, both toggles, and the Sign In button all render with the bordered button style.```
