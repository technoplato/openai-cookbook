Return Value
A view that wraps this view in a compositing group.
Discussion
A compositing group makes compositing effects in this view’s ancestor views, such as opacity and the blend mode, take effect before this view is rendered.
Use compositingGroup() to apply effects to a parent view before applying effects to this view.
In the example below the compositingGroup() modifier separates the application of effects into stages. It applies the opacity(_:) effect to the VStack before the blur(radius:) effect is applied to the views inside the enclosed ZStack. This limits the scope of the opacity change to the outermost view.
VStack {
    ZStack {
        Text("CompositingGroup")
            .foregroundColor(.black)
            .padding(20)
            .background(Color.red)
        Text("CompositingGroup")
            .blur(radius: 2)
    }
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .compositingGroup()
    .opacity(0.9)
}
