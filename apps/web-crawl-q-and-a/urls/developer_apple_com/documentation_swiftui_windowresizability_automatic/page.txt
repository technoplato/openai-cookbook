Discussion
When you use automatic resizability, SwiftUI applies a resizing strategy that’s appropriate for the scene type:
Windows from WindowGroup, Window, and DocumentGroup scene declarations use the contentMinSize strategy.
A window from a Settings scene declaration uses the contentSize strategy.
Automatic resizability is the default if you don’t specify another value using the windowResizability(_:) scene modifier.
