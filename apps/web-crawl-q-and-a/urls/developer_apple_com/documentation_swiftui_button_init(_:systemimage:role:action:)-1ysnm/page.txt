) where S : StringProtocol
Available when Label is Label<Text, Image>.
Parameters
title
A string that describes the purpose of the button’s action.
systemImage
The name of the image resource to lookup.
role
An optional semantic role describing the button. A value of nil means that the button doesn’t have an assigned role.

Discussion
This initializer creates a Label view on your behalf, and treats the title similar to init(_:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
