var isMixed: Bool
Discussion
Use this property to determine whether the toggle style should render a mixed state presentation. A mixed state corresponds to an underlying collection with a mix of true and false Bindings. To toggle the state, use the Bool.toggle() method on the isOn binding.
In the following example, a custom style uses the isMixed property to render the correct toggle state using symbols:
struct SymbolToggleStyle: ToggleStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Button {
            configuration.isOn.toggle()
        } label: {
            Image(
                systemName: configuration.isMixed
                ? "minus.circle.fill" : configuration.isOn
                ? "checkmark.circle.fill" : "circle.fill")
            configuration.label
        }
    }
}
