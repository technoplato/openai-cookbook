func onDrag<V>(
    _ data: @escaping () -> NSItemProvider,
    @ViewBuilder preview: () -> V
) -> some View where V : View
Parameters
data
A closure that returns a single NSItemProvider that represents the draggable data from this view.
preview
A View to use as the source for the dragging preview, once the drag operation has begun. The preview is centered over the source view.
Return Value
A view that activates this view as the source of a drag-and- drop operation, beginning with user gesture input.
Discussion
Applying the onDrag(_:preview:) modifier adds the appropriate gestures for drag and drop to this view. When a drag operation begins, a rendering of preview is generated and used as the preview image.
