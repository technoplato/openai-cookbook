    _ isFocusable: Bool = true,
    onFocusChange: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> some View

Use the focusable(_:) method instead.
Parameters
isFocusable
A Boolean value that indicates whether this view is focusable.
onFocusChange
A closure that’s called whenever this view either gains or loses focus. The Boolean parameter to onFocusChange is true when the view is in focus; otherwise, it’s false.
Return Value
A view that sets whether a view is focusable, and triggers onFocusChange when the view gains or loses focus.
