Instance Method
sizeThatFits(_:nsViewController:context:)
Given a proposed size, returns the preferred size of the composite view.
macOS 13.0+
func sizeThatFits(
    _ proposal: ProposedViewSize,
    nsViewController: Self.NSViewControllerType,
    context: Self.Context
) -> CGSize?
Parameters
proposal
The proposed size for the view controller.
nsViewController
Your custom view controller object.
context
A context structure containing information about the current state of the system.
Return Value
The composite size of the represented view controller. Returning a value of nil indicates that the system should use the default sizing algorithm.
Discussion
This method may be called more than once with different proposed sizes during the same layout pass. SwiftUI views choose their own size, so one of the values returned from this function will always be used as the actual size of the composite view.
Current page is sizeThatFits(_:nsViewController:context:)
