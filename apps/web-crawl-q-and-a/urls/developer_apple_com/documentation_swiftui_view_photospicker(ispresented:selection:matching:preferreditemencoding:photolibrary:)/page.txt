    photoLibrary: PHPhotoLibrary
) -> some View
Parameters
isPresented
The binding to whether the Photos picker should be shown.
selection
The item being shown and selected in the Photos picker.
filter
Types of items that can be shown. Default is nil. Setting it to nil means all supported types can be shown.
preferredItemEncoding
The encoding disambiguation policy of the selected item. Default is .automatic. Setting it to .automatic means the best encoding determined by the system will be used.
photoLibrary
The photo library to choose from.
Discussion
The user explicitly grants access only to items they choose, so photo library access authorization is not needed.
