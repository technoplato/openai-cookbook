Initializer
init(_:isOn:)
Creates a toggle that generates its label from a localized string key.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    isOn: Binding<Bool>
)
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the toggle’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the toggle.
isOn
A binding to a property that indicates whether the toggle is on or off.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a toggle with a string variable, use init(_:isOn:) instead.
