static let listRowSeparatorLeading: HorizontalAlignment
Discussion
Use this guide to align the leading end of the bottom List row separator with any other horizontal guide of a view that is part of the cell content.
The following example shows the row separator aligned with the leading edge of the Text containing the name of food:
List {
    ForEach(favoriteFoods) { food in
        HStack {
            Text(food.emoji)
                .font(.system(size: 40))
            Text(food.name)
                .alignmentGuide(.listRowSeparatorLeading) {
                    $0[.leading]
                }
        }
    }
}
To change the visibility or tint of the row separator use respectively listRowSeparator(_:edges:) and listRowSeparatorTint(_:edges:).
