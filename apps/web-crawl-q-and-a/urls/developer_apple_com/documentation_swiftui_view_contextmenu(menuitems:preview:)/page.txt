Discussion
When you use this modifer to add a context menu to a view in your app’s user interface, the system shows a preview beside the menu. Compose the menu by returning controls like Button, Toggle, and Picker from the menuItems closure. You can also use Menu to define submenus or Section to group items.
Define the preview by returning a view from the preview closure. The system sizes the preview to match the size of its content. For example, you can add a two button context menu to a Text view, and include an Image as a preview:
Text("Turtle Rock")
    .padding()
    .contextMenu {
        Button {
            // Add this item to a list of favorites.
        } label: {
            Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
        }
        Button {
            // Open Maps and center it on this item.
        } label: {
            Label("Show in Maps", systemImage: "mappin")
        }
    } preview: {
        Image("turtlerock") // Loads the image from an asset catalog.
    }
When someone activates the context menu with an action like touch and hold in iOS or iPadOS, the system displays the image and the menu:
Note
This view modifier produces a context menu on macOS, but that platform doesn’t display the preview.
If you don’t need a preview, use contextMenu(menuItems:) instead. If you want to add a context menu to a container that supports selection, like a List or a Table, and you want to distinguish between menu activation on a selection and activation in an empty area of the container, use contextMenu(forSelectionType:menu:primaryAction:).
