func makeNSViewController(context: Self.Context) -> Self.NSViewControllerType
Required
Parameters
context
A context structure containing information about the current state of the system.
Return Value
Your AppKit view controller configured with the provided information.
Discussion
You must implement this method and use it to create your view controller object. Create the view controller using your app’s current data and contents of the context parameter. The system calls this method only once, when it creates your view controller for the first time. For all subsequent updates, the system calls the updateNSViewController(_:context:) method.
