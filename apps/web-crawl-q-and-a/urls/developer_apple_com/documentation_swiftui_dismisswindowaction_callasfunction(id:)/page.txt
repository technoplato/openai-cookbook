func callAsFunction(id: String)
Parameters
id
The identifier of the scene to dismiss.
Discussion
When the specified identifier represents a WindowGroup, all of the open windows in that group will be dismissed. For dismissing a single window associated to a WindowGroup scene, use dismissWindow(value:) or dismissWindow(id:value:).
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the dismissWindow action with an identifier:
dismissWindow(id: "message")
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
