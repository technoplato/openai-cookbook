    id: ID,
    in namespace: Namespace.ID
) -> some View where ID : Hashable
Parameters
id
An arbitrary hashable identifier. Pass this same value when initializing an AccessibilityRotorEntry.
namespace
A namespace created with @Namespace(). Pass this same namespace when initializing an AccessibilityRotorEntry.
Discussion
Use this when creating an AccessibilityRotorEntry without a namespace does not allow SwiftUI to automatically find and reveal the element, or when the Rotor entry should be associated with a sub-element of a complex view generated in a ForEach, for example.
