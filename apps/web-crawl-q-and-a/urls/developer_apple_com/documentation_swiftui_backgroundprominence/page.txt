struct BackgroundProminence
Overview
Background prominence should influence foreground styling to maintain sufficient contrast against the background. For example, selected rows in a List and Table can have increased prominence backgrounds with accent color fills when focused; the foreground content above the background should be adjusted to reflect that level of prominence.
This can be read and written for views with the EnvironmentValues.backgroundProminence property.
