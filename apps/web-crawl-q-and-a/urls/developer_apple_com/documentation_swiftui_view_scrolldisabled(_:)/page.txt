A Boolean that indicates whether scrolling is disabled.
Discussion
Use this modifier to control whether a ScrollView can scroll:
@State private var isScrollDisabled = false


var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
        VStack {
            Toggle("Disable", isOn: $isScrollDisabled)
            MyContent()
        }
    }
    .scrollDisabled(isScrollDisabled)
}
SwiftUI passes the disabled property through the environment, which means you can use this modifier to disable scrolling for all scroll views within a view hierarchy. In the following example, the modifier affects both scroll views:
 ScrollView {
     ForEach(rows) { row in
         ScrollView(.horizontal) {
             RowContent(row)
         }
     }
 }
 .scrollDisabled(true)
You can also use this modifier to disable scrolling for other kinds of scrollable views, like a List or a TextEditor.
