init()
Discussion
You don’t typically create an instance of EnvironmentValues directly. Doing so would provide access only to default values that don’t update based on system settings or device characteristics. Instead, you rely on an environment values’ instance that SwiftUI manages for you when you use the Environment property wrapper and the environment(_:_:) view modifier.
