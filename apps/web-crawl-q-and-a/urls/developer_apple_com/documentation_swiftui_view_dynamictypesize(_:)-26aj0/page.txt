Instance Method
dynamicTypeSize(_:)
Limits the Dynamic Type size within the view to the given range.

func dynamicTypeSize<T>(_ range: T) -> some View where T : RangeExpression, T.Bound == DynamicTypeSize
Parameters
range
The range of sizes that are allowed in this view.
Return Value
A view that constrains the Dynamic Type size of this view within the specified range.
Discussion
As an example, you can constrain the maximum Dynamic Type size in ContentView to be no larger than DynamicTypeSize.large:
ContentView()
    .dynamicTypeSize(...DynamicTypeSize.large)
If the Dynamic Type size is limited to multiple ranges, the result is their intersection:
ContentView() // Dynamic Type sizes are from .small to .large
    .dynamicTypeSize(.small...)
    .dynamicTypeSize(...DynamicTypeSize.large)
A specific Dynamic Type size can still be set after a range is applied:
ContentView() // Dynamic Type size is .xLarge
    .dynamicTypeSize(.xLarge)
    .dynamicTypeSize(...DynamicTypeSize.large)
When limiting the Dynamic Type size, consider if adding a large content view with accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer() would be appropriate.
