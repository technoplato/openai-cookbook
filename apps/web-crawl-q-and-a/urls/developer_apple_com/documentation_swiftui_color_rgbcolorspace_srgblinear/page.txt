Discussion
This color space has the same colorimetry as Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGB, but uses a linear transfer function.
Standard sRGB color spaces clamp the red, green, and blue components of a color to a range of 0 to 1, but SwiftUI colors use an extended sRGB color space, so you can use component values outside that range.
