func scrollTransition(
    _ configuration: ScrollTransitionConfiguration = .interactive,
    axis: Axis? = nil,
    transition: @escaping (EmptyVisualEffect, ScrollTransitionPhase) -> some VisualEffect
) -> some View
Parameters
configuration
The configuration controlling how the transition will be applied. The configuration will be applied both while the view is coming into view and while it is disappearing (the transition is symmetrical).
axis
The axis of the containing scroll view over which the transition will be applied. The default value of nil uses the axis of the innermost containing scroll view, or .vertical if the innermost scroll view is scrollable along both axes.
coordinateSpace
The coordinate space of the container that visibility is evaluated within. Defaults to .scrollView.
transition
A closure that applies visual effects as a function of the provided phase.
