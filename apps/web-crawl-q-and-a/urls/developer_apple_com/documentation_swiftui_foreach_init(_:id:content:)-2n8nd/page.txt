Initializer
init(_:id:content:)
Creates an instance that uniquely identifies and creates views across updates based on the identity of the underlying data.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<C>(
    _ data: Binding<C>,
    id: KeyPath<C.Element, ID>,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<C.Element>) -> Content
) where Data == LazyMapSequence<C.Indices, (C.Index, ID)>, C : MutableCollection, C : RandomAccessCollection, C.Index : Hashable
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
data
The identified data that the ForEach instance uses to create views dynamically.
id
The key path to the provided data’s identifier.
content
The view builder that creates views dynamically.
Discussion
It’s important that the id of a data element doesn’t change unless you replace the data element with a new data element that has a new identity. If the id of a data element changes, the content view generated from that data element loses any current state and animations.
