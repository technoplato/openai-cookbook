Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a UIKit app delegate adaptor using an observable delegate.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
init(_ delegateType: DelegateType.Type = DelegateType.self)
Available when DelegateType inherits NSObject, DelegateType conforms to Observable, and DelegateType conforms to UIApplicationDelegate.
Parameters
delegateType
The type of application delegate that you define in your app, which conforms to the UIApplicationDelegate and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocols.
Discussion
Call this initializer indirectly by creating a property with the UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor property wrapper from inside your App declaration:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor private var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate


    var body: some Scene { ... }
}
SwiftUI initializes the delegate and manages its lifetime, calling it as needed to handle application delegate callbacks.
SwiftUI invokes this method when your app delegate conforms to the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocol. In this case, SwiftUI automatically places the delegate in the Environment. You can access such a delegate from any scene or view in your app using the Environment property wrapper:
@Environment(MyAppDelegate.self) private var appDelegate
If your delegate isn’t observable, SwiftUI invokes the init(_:) initializer rather than this one, and doesn’t put the delegate instance in the environment.
