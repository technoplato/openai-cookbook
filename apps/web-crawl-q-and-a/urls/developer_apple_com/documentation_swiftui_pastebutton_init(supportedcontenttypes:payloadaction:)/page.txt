Initializer
init(supportedContentTypes:payloadAction:)
Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
init(
    supportedContentTypes: [UTType],
    payloadAction: @escaping ([NSItemProvider]) -> Void
)
Parameters
supportedContentTypes
The exact uniform type identifiers supported by the button. If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the button becomes disabled.
payloadAction
The handler to call when the user clicks the Paste button and the pasteboard has items that conform to supportedContentTypes. This closure receives an array of item providers that you use to inspect and load the pasteboard data.
Discussion
Set the contents of supportedContentTypes in order of your app’s preference for its supported types. The Paste button takes the most-preferred type that the pasteboard source supports and delivers this to the payloadAction closure.
