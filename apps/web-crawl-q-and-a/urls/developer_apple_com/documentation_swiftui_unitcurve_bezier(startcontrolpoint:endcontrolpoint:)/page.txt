Type Method
bezier(startControlPoint:endControlPoint:)
Creates a new curve using bezier control points.

static func bezier(
    startControlPoint: UnitPoint,
    endControlPoint: UnitPoint
) -> UnitCurve
Parameters
startControlPoint
The cubic Bézier control point associated with the curve’s start point at (0, 0). The tangent vector from the start point to its control point defines the initial velocity of the timing function.
endControlPoint
The cubic Bézier control point associated with the curve’s end point at (1, 1). The tangent vector from the end point to its control point defines the final velocity of the timing function.
Discussion
The x components of the control points are clamped to the range [0,1] when the curve is evaluated.
