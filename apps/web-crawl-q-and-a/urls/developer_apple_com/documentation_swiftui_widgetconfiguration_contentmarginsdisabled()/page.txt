func contentMarginsDisabled() -> some WidgetConfiguration
Return Value
A modified widget configuration that doesn’t use default content margins.
Discussion
When you disable content margins for a widget, the system doesn’t automatically add margins around the widget’s content, and you are responsible for specifying margins and padding around your widget content for each context. To specify custom margins, use widgetContentMargins in combination with View/padding(_) to selectively or partially apply the default content margins.
This modifier has no effect on operation system versions prior to iOS 17, watchOS 10, or macOS 14.
