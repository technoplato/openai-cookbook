var isLogicallyComplete: Bool
Discussion
This controls when AnimationCompletionCriteria.logicallyComplete completion callbacks are fired. This should be set to true at most once in the life of an animation, changing back to false later will be ignored. If this is never set to true, the behavior is equivalent to if this had been set to true just as the animation finished (by returning nil).
