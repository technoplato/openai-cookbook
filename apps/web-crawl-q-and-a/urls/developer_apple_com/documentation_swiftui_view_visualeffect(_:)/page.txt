Instance Method
visualEffect(_:)
Applies effects to this view, while providing access to layout information via GeometryProxy.
iOS 17.0+ Beta

func visualEffect(_ effect: @escaping (EmptyVisualEffect, GeometryProxy) -> some VisualEffect) -> some View
Parameters
effect
A closure that returns the effect to be applied. The first argument provided to the closure is a placeholder representing this view. The second argument is a GeometryProxy.
Return Value
A view with the effect applied.
Discussion
You return new effects by calling functions on the first argument provided to the effect closure. In this example, ContentView is offset by its own size, causing its top left corner to appear where the bottom right corner was originally located:
ContentView()
    .visualEffect { content, geometryProxy in
        content.offset(geometryProxy.size)
    }
