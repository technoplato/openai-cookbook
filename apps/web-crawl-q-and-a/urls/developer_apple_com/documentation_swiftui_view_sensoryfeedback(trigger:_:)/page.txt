Discussion
For example, you could play different feedback for different state transitions:
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var phase = Phase.inactive


    var body: some View {
        ContentView(phase: $phase)
            .sensoryFeedback(trigger: phase) { old, new in
                switch (old, new) {
                    case (.inactive, _): return .success
                    case (_, .expanded): return .impact
                    default: return nil
                }
            }
    }


    enum Phase {
        case inactive
        case preparing
        case active
        case expanded
    }
}
