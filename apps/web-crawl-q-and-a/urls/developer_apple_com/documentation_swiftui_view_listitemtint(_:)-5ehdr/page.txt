func listItemTint(_ tint: Color?) -> some View
Parameters
color
The color to use to tint the content, or nil to not override the inherited tint.
Discussion
This is equivalent to using a tint of ListItemTint.fixed(_:) with the provided tint color.
The containing list’s style will apply that tint as appropriate. watchOS uses the tint color for its background platter appearance. Sidebars on iOS and macOS apply the tint color to their Label icons, which otherwise use the accent color by default.
