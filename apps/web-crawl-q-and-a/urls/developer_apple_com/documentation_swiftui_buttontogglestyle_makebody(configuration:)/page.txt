func makeBody(configuration: ButtonToggleStyle.Configuration) -> some View
Parameters
configuration
The properties of the toggle, including a label and a binding to the toggle’s state.
Return Value
A view that acts as a button that controls a Boolean state.
Discussion
SwiftUI implements this required method of the ToggleStyle protocol to define the behavior and appearance of the button toggle style. Don’t call this method directly; the system calls this method for each Toggle instance in a view hierarchy that’s styled as a button.
