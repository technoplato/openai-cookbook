enum PreviewPlatform
Overview
Xcode infers the platform for a preview based on the currently selected target. If you have a multiplatform target and want to suggest a particular target for a preview, implement the platform computed property as a hint, and specify one of the preview platforms:
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
    }


    static var platform: PreviewPlatform? {
        PreviewPlatform.tvOS
    }
}
