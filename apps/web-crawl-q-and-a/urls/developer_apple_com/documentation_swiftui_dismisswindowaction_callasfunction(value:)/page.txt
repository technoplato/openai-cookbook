func callAsFunction<D>(value: D) where D : Decodable, D : Encodable, D : Hashable
Parameters
value
The value which is currently presented.
Discussion
If multiple windows match the provided value, then they all will be dismissed. For dismissing a specific window in a specific group, use dismissWindow(id:value:).
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the dismissWindow action with an identifier and a value:
dismissWindow(value: message.id)
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
