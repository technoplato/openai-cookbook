Discussion
For information about the sRGB colorimetry and nonlinear transform function, see the IEC 61966-2-1 specification.
Standard sRGB color spaces clamp the red, green, and blue components of a color to a range of 0 to 1, but SwiftUI colors use an extended sRGB color space, so you can use component values outside that range.
