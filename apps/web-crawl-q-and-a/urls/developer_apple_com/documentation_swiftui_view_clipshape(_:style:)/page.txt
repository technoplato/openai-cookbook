Instance Method

func clipShape<S>(
    _ shape: S,
    style: FillStyle = FillStyle()
) -> some View where S : Shape
Parameters
shape
The clipping shape to use for this view. The shape fills the view’s frame, while maintaining its aspect ratio.
style
The fill style to use when rasterizing shape.
Return Value
A view that clips this view to shape, using style to define the shape’s rasterization.
Discussion
Use clipShape(_:style:) to clip the view to the provided shape. By applying a clipping shape to a view, you preserve the parts of the view covered by the shape, while eliminating other parts of the view. The clipping shape itself isn’t visible.
For example, this code applies a circular clipping shape to a Text view:
Text("Clipped text in a circle")
    .frame(width: 175, height: 100)
    .foregroundColor(Color.white)
    .background(Color.black)
    .clipShape(Circle())
The resulting view shows only the portion of the text that lies within the bounds of the circle.
