Making gestures accessible
func accessibilityActivationPoint(CGPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.
func accessibilityActivationPoint(UnitPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.
func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.
Beta
func accessibilityZoomAction((AccessibilityZoomGestureAction) -> Void) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Adds an accessibility zoom action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.
struct AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions
An option set that defines the functionality of a view’s direct touch area.
