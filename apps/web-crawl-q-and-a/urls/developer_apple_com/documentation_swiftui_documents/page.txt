Documents
Enable people to open and manage documents.
Overview
Create a user interface for opening and editing documents using the DocumentGroup scene type.
You initialize the scene with a model that describes the organization of the document’s data, and a view hierarchy that SwiftUI uses to display the document’s contents to the user. You can use either a value type model, which you typically store as a structure, that conforms to the FileDocument protocol, or a reference type model you store in a class instance that conforms to the ReferenceFileDocument protocol.
SwiftUI supports standard behaviors that users expect from a document-based app, appropriate for each platform, like multiwindow support, open and save panels, drag and drop, and so on. For related design guidance, see Patterns in the Human Interface Guidelines.
