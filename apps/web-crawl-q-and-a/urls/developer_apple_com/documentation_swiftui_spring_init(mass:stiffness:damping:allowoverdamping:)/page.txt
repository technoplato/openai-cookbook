Initializer
init(mass:stiffness:damping:allowOverDamping:)
Creates a spring with the specified mass, stiffness, and damping.
iOS 17.0+ Beta

init(
    mass: Double = 1.0,
    stiffness: Double,
    damping: Double,
    allowOverDamping: Bool = false
)
Parameters
mass
Specifies that property of the object attached to the end of the spring.
stiffness
The corresponding spring coefficient.
damping
Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.
allowOverdamping
A value of true specifies that over-damping should be allowed when appropriate based on the other inputs, and a value of false specifies that such cases should instead be treated as critically damped.
