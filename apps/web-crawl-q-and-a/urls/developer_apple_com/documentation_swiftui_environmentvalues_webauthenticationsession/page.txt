Discussion
For example, you can start a web authentication session when the user taps a button:
struct WebAuthenticationSessionExample: View {
    @Environment(\.webAuthenticationSession) private var webAuthenticationSession


    var body: some View {
        Button("Sign In") {
            Task {
                do {
                    let urlWithToken = try await webAuthenticationSession.authenticate(
                        using: URL(string: "https://www.example.com")!,
                        callbackURLScheme: "x-example-app")
                    try await signIn(using: urlWithToken) // defined elsewhere
                } catch {
                    // code to handle authentication errors
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
Use WebAuthenticationSession/BrowserSession/ephemeral to request that the browser doesn’t share cookies or other browsing data between the authentication session and the user’s normal browser session. Whether the request is honored depends on the user’s default web browser. Safari always honors the request.
let urlWithToken = try await webAuthenticationSession.authenticate(
    using: URL(string: "https://www.example.com")!,
    callbackURLScheme: "x-example-app",
    preferredBrowserSession: .ephemeral)
After the user authenticates, the authentication provider redirects the browser to a URL that uses the callback scheme. The browser detects the redirect, dismisses itself, and the complete URL will be returned. Inspect the URL to determine the outcome of the authentication:
let queryItems = URLComponents(string: urlWithToken.absoluteString)?.queryItems
let token = queryItems?.first(where: { $0.name == "token" })?.value
The above example looks for a token stored as a query parameter. The specific parsing that you have to do depends on how the authentication provider structures the callback URL.
