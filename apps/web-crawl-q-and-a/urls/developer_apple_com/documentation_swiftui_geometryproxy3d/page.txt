Structure
GeometryProxy3D
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space of the container view.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
struct GeometryProxy3D
Overview
You can use a proxy for anchor resolution.
Topics
Accessing geometry characteristics
func frame(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> Rect3D
The container view’s bounds rectangle converted to a defined coordinate space.
func immersiveSpaceDisplacement(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> Pose3D
var size: Size3D
The size of the container view.
var safeAreaInsets: EdgeInsets3D
The safe area inset of the container view.
subscript<T>(Anchor<T>) -> T
Resolves the value of anchor to the container view.
func transform(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> AffineTransform3D?
The container view’s 3D transform converted to a defined coordinate space. If the view does not have a well-defined transform, such as if it is affected by a projection transform, this function may return nil.

Measuring a view
struct GeometryReader
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
struct GeometryReader3D
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
Beta
struct GeometryProxy
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space (for anchor resolution) of the container view.
func coordinateSpace(NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View
Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.
Beta
enum CoordinateSpace
A resolved coordinate space created by CoordinateSpaceProtocol.
protocol CoordinateSpaceProtocol
A frame of reference within the layout system.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetric
Provides access to a value in points that corresponds to the specified physical measurement.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetricsConverter
A physical metrics converter provides conversion between point values and their extent in 3D space, in the form of physical length measurements.
