Swift
Instance Method
callAsFunction(_:)
Presents a new reference type document window.
macOS 13.0+
func callAsFunction<D>(_ newDocument: @escaping () -> D) where D : ReferenceFileDocument
Parameters
newDocument
The new reference type file document to present.
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the newDocument action:
newDocument(TextDocument(text: selectedText))
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
