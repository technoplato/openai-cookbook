Instance Method
fileMover(isPresented:files:onCompletion:onCancellation:)
Presents a system dialog for allowing the user to move a collection of existing files to a new location.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileMover<C>(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    files: C,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<[URL], Error>) -> Void,
    onCancellation: @escaping () -> Void
) -> some View where C : Collection, C.Element == URL
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the dialog should be shown.
files
A collection of URLs for the files to be moved.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has succeeded or failed. The result indicates whether the operation succeeded or failed. To access the received URLs, call startAccessingSecurityScopedResource. When the access is no longer required, call stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource.
onCancellation
A callback that will be invoked if the user cancels the operation.
Discussion
Note
This dialog provides security-scoped URLs. Call the startAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to access or bookmark the URLs, and the stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to release the access.
For example, a button that allows the user to move files might look like this:
  struct MoveFilesButton: View {
      @Binding var files: [URL]
      @State private var showFileMover = false
      var onCompletion: (URL) -> Void
      var onCancellation: (() -> Void)?


      var body: some View {
          Button {
              showFileMover = true
          } label: {
              Label("Choose destination", systemImage: "folder.circle")
          }
          .fileMover(isPresented: $showFileMover, files: files) { result in
              switch result {
              case .success(let urls):
                  urls.forEach { url in
                      guard url.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource() else {
                          return
                      }
                      onCompletion(url)
                      url.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()
                  }
              case .failure(let error):
                  print(error)
                  // handle error
              }
          } onCancellation: {
              onCancellation?()
          }
      }
  }
