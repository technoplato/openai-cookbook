var projectedValue: Binding<Value> { get }
Discussion
Use the projected value to pass a binding value down a view hierarchy. To get the projectedValue, prefix the property variable with $. For example, in the following code example PlayerView projects a binding of the state property isPlaying to the PlayButton view using $isPlaying.
struct PlayerView: View {
    var episode: Episode
    @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(episode.title)
                .foregroundStyle(isPlaying ? .primary : .secondary)
            PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying)
        }
    }
}
