func labelsHidden() -> some View
Discussion
Use this modifier when you want to omit a label from one or more controls in your user interface. For example, the first Toggle in the following example hides its label:
VStack {
    Toggle(isOn: $toggle1) {
        Text("Toggle 1")
    }
    .labelsHidden()


    Toggle(isOn: $toggle2) {
        Text("Toggle 2")
    }
}
The VStack in the example above centers the first toggle’s control element in the available space, while it centers the second toggle’s combined label and control element:
Always provide a label for controls, even when you hide the label, because SwiftUI uses labels for other purposes, including accessibility.
Note
This modifier doesn’t work for all labels. It applies to labels that are separate from the rest of the control’s interface, like they are for Toggle, but not to controls like a bordered button where the label is inside the button’s border.
