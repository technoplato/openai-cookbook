struct DragGesture
Overview
To recognize a drag gesture on a view, create and configure the gesture, and then add it to the view using the gesture(_:including:) modifier.
Add a drag gesture to a Circle and change its color while the user performs the drag gesture:
struct DragGestureView: View {
    @State private var isDragging = false


    var drag: some Gesture {
        DragGesture()
            .onChanged { _ in self.isDragging = true }
            .onEnded { _ in self.isDragging = false }
    }


    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(self.isDragging ? Color.red : Color.blue)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100, alignment: .center)
            .gesture(drag)
    }
}
