Discussion
Define this type to represent all the data that your document stores. When someone issues a Save command, SwiftUI asks your document for a value of this type by calling the document’s snapshot(contentType:) method. SwiftUI sends the snapshot that you provide to the document’s fileWrapper(snapshot:configuration:) method, where you serialize the contents of the snapshot into a file wrapper.
