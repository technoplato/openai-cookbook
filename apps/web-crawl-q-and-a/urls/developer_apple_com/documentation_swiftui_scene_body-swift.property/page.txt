Discussion
For any scene that you create, provide a computed body property that defines the scene as a composition of other scenes. You can assemble a scene from built-in scenes that SwiftUI provides, as well as other scenes that you’ve defined.
Swift infers the scene’s Body associated type based on the contents of the body property.
