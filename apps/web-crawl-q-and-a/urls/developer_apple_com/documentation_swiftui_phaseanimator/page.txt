Creating a phase animator
init(some Sequence<Phase>, content: (Phase) -> Content, animation: (Phase) -> Animation?)
Cycles through the given phases continuously, updating the content using the view builder closure that you supply.
init(some Sequence<Phase>, trigger: some Equatable, content: (Phase) -> Content, animation: (Phase) -> Animation?)
Cycles through the given phases when the trigger value changes, updating the view builder closure that you supply.
