func union(
    _ other: ViewSpacing,
    edges: Edge.Set = .all
) -> ViewSpacing
Parameters
other
Another spacing preferences instance to merge with this one.
edges
The edges to merge. Edges that you don’t specify are unchanged after the method completes.
Return Value
A new view spacing preferences instance with the merged values.
Discussion
This method behaves like formUnion(_:edges:), except that it creates a copy of the original spacing preferences instance before merging, leaving the original instance unmodified.
