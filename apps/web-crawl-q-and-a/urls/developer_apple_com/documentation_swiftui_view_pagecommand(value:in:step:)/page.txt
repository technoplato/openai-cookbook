Swift
Instance Method
pageCommand(value:in:step:)
Steps a value through a range in response to page up or page down commands.
tvOS 14.3+
func pageCommand<V>(
    value: Binding<V>,
    in bounds: ClosedRange<V>,
    step: V = 1
) -> some View where V : BinaryInteger
Parameters
value
A Binding to the value to modify when the user pages up or down.
bounds
A closed range that specifies the upper and lower bounds of value.
step
The amount by which to increment or decrement value. Defaults to 1.
Discussion
Use this command to step through sections of a data model associated with a view by providing a binding to a value, a range, and step. If taking another step would cause the value to exceed the bounds, then the value remains unchanged.
On tvOS, the user triggers ‘pageUp’ and ‘pageDown’ commands by pressing a dedicated button on a connected remote. For example, you can let a user page through a TV programming guide using the channel buttons:
struct GuideView: View {
    @State private var pageOffset: Int = 0


    var body: some View {
        GuideContent(at: pageOffset)
            .pageCommand(
                value: $pageOffset,
                in: 0...9,
                step: 1)
    }
}

Responding to commands
func onMoveCommand(perform: ((MoveCommandDirection) -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to a move command, like when the user presses an arrow key on a Mac keyboard, or taps the edge of the Siri Remote when controlling an Apple TV.
func onDeleteCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Delete command, or pressing either the ⌫ (backspace) or ⌦ (forward delete) keys while the view has focus.
func onExitCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Sets up an action that triggers in response to receiving the exit command while the view has focus.
func onPlayPauseCommand(perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Play/Pause command.
func onCommand(Selector, perform: (() -> Void)?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the given selector.
enum MoveCommandDirection
Specifies the direction of an arrow key movement.
Current page is pageCommand(value:in:step:)
