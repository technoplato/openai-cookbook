protocol VectorArithmetic : AdditiveArithmetic
Overview
VectorArithmetic extends the AdditiveArithmetic protocol with scalar multiplication and a way to query the vector magnitude of the value. Use this type as the animatableData associated type of a type that conforms to the Animatable protocol.
Topics
Manipulating values
var magnitudeSquared: Double
Returns the dot-product of this vector arithmetic instance with itself.
Required
func scale(by: Double)
Multiplies each component of this value by the given value.
Required Default implementation provided.
func scaled(by: Double) -> Self
Returns a value with each component of this value multiplied by the given value.
func interpolate(towards: Self, amount: Double)
Interpolates this value with other by the specified amount.
func interpolated(towards: Self, amount: Double) -> Self
Returns this value interpolated with other by the specified amount.
