Discussion
You receive a UserInterfaceSizeClass value when you read this environment value. The value tells you about the amount of vertical space available to the view that reads it. You can read this size class like any other of the EnvironmentValues, by creating a property with the Environment property wrapper:
@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass) private var verticalSizeClass
SwiftUI sets this size class based on several factors, including:
The current device type.
The orientation of the device.
You can adjust the appearance of custom views by reading this size class and conditioning your views. If you do, be prepared to handle size class changes while your app runs, because factors like device orientation can change at runtime.
In watchOS, the vertical size class is always UserInterfaceSizeClass.compact. In macOS, and tvOS, it’s always UserInterfaceSizeClass.regular.
Writing to the vertical size class in the environment before macOS 14.0, tvOS 17.0, and watchOS 10.0 is not supported.
