struct UIViewControllerRepresentableContext<Representable> where Representable : UIViewControllerRepresentable
Overview
A UIViewControllerRepresentableContext structure contains details about the current state of the system. When creating and updating your view controller, the system creates one of these structures and passes it to the appropriate method of your custom UIViewControllerRepresentable instance. Use the information in this structure to configure your view controller. For example, use the provided environment values to configure the appearance of your view controller and views. Don’t create this structure yourself.

let coordinator: Representable.Coordinator
