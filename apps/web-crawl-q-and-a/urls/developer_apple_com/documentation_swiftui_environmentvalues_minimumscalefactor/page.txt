Instance Property
minimumScaleFactor
The minimum permissible proportion to shrink the font size to fit the text into the available space.
iOS 13.0+

visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var minimumScaleFactor: CGFloat { get set }
Discussion
In the example below, a label with a minimumScaleFactor of 0.5 draws its text in a font size as small as half of the actual font if needed to fit into the space next to the text input field:
HStack {
    Text("This is a very long label:")
        .lineLimit(1)
        .minimumScaleFactor(0.5)
    TextField("My Long Text Field", text: $myTextField)
        .frame(width: 250, height: 50, alignment: .center)
}
You can set the minimum scale factor to any value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. The default value is 1.
SwiftUI uses this value to shrink text that doesn’t fit in a view when it’s okay to shrink the text. For example, a label with a minimumScaleFactor of 0.5 draws its text in a font size as small as half the actual font if needed.
