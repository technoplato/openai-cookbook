Initializer
init(constrainedToAxis:minimumAngleDelta:)
Creates a rotation gesture with a minimum delta for the gesture to start and axis to constrain measurement of rotation.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    constrainedToAxis: RotationAxis3D? = nil,
    minimumAngleDelta: Angle = .degrees(1)
)
Parameters
constrainedToAxis
The 3D axis about which rotation is measured.
minimumAngleDelta
The minimum delta required before the gesture starts. The default value is a one-degree angle.
Discussion
If the constrained axis is nil, the gesture measures unconstrained 3D rotation.
See Also
Creating the gesture
var minimumAngleDelta: Angle
The minimum angle delta before the gesture becomes active.
Beta
var constrainedAxis: RotationAxis3D?
An axis around which the rotation is constrained.
