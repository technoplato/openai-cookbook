Structure
GraphicsContext.Filter
A type that applies image processing operations to rendered content.

struct Filter
Overview
Create and configure a filter that produces an image processing effect, like adding a drop shadow or a blur effect, by calling one of the factory methods defined by the Filter structure. Call the addFilter(_:options:) method to add the filter to a GraphicsContext. The filter only affects content that you draw into the context after adding the filter.
Topics
Changing brightness and contrast
static func brightness(Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a brightness adjustment.
static func contrast(Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a contrast adjustment.
Manipulating color
static func saturation(Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a saturation adjustment.
static func colorInvert(Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that inverts the color of their results.
static func colorMultiply(Color) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that multiplies each color component by the matching component of a given color.
static func hueRotation(Angle) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a hue rotation adjustment.
static func grayscale(Double) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a grayscale adjustment.
static func colorMatrix(ColorMatrix) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that multiplies by a given color matrix.
Adding blur
static func blur(radius: CGFloat, options: GraphicsContext.BlurOptions) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies a Gaussian blur.
Adding a shadow
static func shadow(color: Color, radius: CGFloat, x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, blendMode: GraphicsContext.BlendMode, options: GraphicsContext.ShadowOptions) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that adds a shadow.
Adjusting opacity
static var luminanceToAlpha: GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that sets the opacity of each pixel based on its luminance.
static func alphaThreshold(min: Double, max: Double, color: Color) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that replaces each pixel with alpha components within a range by a constant color, or transparency otherwise.
Adding a transformation
static func projectionTransform(ProjectionTransform) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that that transforms the rasterized form of subsequent graphics primitives.
Using a custom Metal shader
static func colorShader(Shader) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies shader to the color of each source pixel.
Beta
static func distortionShader(Shader, maxSampleOffset: CGSize) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies shader as a geometric distortion effect on the location of each pixel.
Beta
static func layerShader(Shader, maxSampleOffset: CGSize) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Returns a filter that applies shader to the contents of the source layer.
