Instance Method

Presents a system interface for allowing the user to move an existing file to a new location.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileMover(
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    file: URL?,
    onCompletion: @escaping (Result<URL, Error>) -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
isPresented
A binding to whether the interface should be shown.
file
The URL of the file to be moved.
onCompletion
A callback that will be invoked when the operation has has succeeded or failed. To access the received URLs, call startAccessingSecurityScopedResource. When the access is no longer required, call stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource.
result
A Result indicating whether the operation succeeded or failed.
Discussion
Note
This interface provides security-scoped URLs. Call the startAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to access or bookmark the URLs, and the stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource method to release the access.
In order for the interface to appear, both isPresented must be true and file must not be nil. When the operation is finished, isPresented will be set to false before onCompletion is called. If the user cancels the operation, isPresented will be set to false and onCompletion will not be called.
