Type Property
card
A button style that doesn’t pad the content, and applies a motion effect when a button has focus.
tvOS 14.0+
static var card: CardButtonStyle { get }
Available when Self is CardButtonStyle.
Discussion
This style doesn’t apply padding to its contents, so images, text, and other content display edge-to-edge. A button with this style appears partially translucent. When the user focuses on a card button, the button animates up to a raised position with more opacity. This style also applies the standard background colors for unfocused and focused states in both light and dark mode.
To apply this style to a button, or to a view that contains buttons, use the buttonStyle(_:) modifier.
