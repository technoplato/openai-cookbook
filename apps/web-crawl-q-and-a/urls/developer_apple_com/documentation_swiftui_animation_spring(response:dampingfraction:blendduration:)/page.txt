Type Method
spring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)
A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other spring() or interactiveSpring() animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.
iOS 13.0+

Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
static func spring(
    response: Double = 0.5,
    dampingFraction: Double = 0.825,
    blendDuration: TimeInterval = 0
) -> Animation
Parameters
response
The stiffness of the spring, defined as an approximate duration in seconds. A value of zero requests an infinitely-stiff spring, suitable for driving interactive animations.
dampingFraction
The amount of drag applied to the value being animated, as a fraction of an estimate of amount needed to produce critical damping.
blendDuration
The duration in seconds over which to interpolate changes to the response value of the spring.
Return Value
a spring animation.

static var spring: Animation
A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other spring() or interactiveSpring() animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.
static func spring(Spring, blendDuration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
A persistent spring animation.
Beta
static func spring(duration: TimeInterval, bounce: Double, blendDuration: Double) -> Animation
A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other spring() or interactiveSpring() animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the duration values between springs over a time period.
static var interactiveSpring: Animation
A convenience for a spring animation with a lower duration value, intended for driving interactive animations.
static func interactiveSpring(response: Double, dampingFraction: Double, blendDuration: TimeInterval) -> Animation
A convenience for a spring animation with a lower response value, intended for driving interactive animations.
static var interpolatingSpring: Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
static func interpolatingSpring(Spring, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range of one to zero.
Beta
static func interpolatingSpring(duration: TimeInterval, bounce: Double, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
static func interpolatingSpring(mass: Double, stiffness: Double, damping: Double, initialVelocity: Double) -> Animation
An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.
