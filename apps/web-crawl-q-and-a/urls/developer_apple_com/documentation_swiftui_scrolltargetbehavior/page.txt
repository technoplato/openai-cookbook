Protocol
ScrollTargetBehavior
A type that defines the scroll behavior of a scrollable view.

protocol ScrollTargetBehavior
Overview
A scrollable view calculates where scroll gestures should end using its deceleration rate and the state of its scroll gesture by default. A scroll behavior allows for customizing this logic.
You define a scroll behavior using the updateTarget(_:context:) method.
Using this method, you can control where someone can scroll in a scrollable view. For example, you can create a custom scroll behavior that aligns to every 10 points by doing the following:
struct BasicScrollTargetBehavior: ScrollTargetBehavior {
    func updateTarget(_ target: inout Target, context: TargetContext) {
        // Align to every 1/10 the size of the scroll view.
        target.rect.x.round(
            toMultipleOf: round(context.containerSize.width / 10.0))
    }
}
Paging Behavior
SwiftUI offers built in scroll behaviors. One such behavior is the PagingScrollTargetBehavior which uses the geometry of the scroll view to decide where to allow scrolls to end.
In the following example, every view in the lazy stack is flexible in both directions and the scroll view will settle to container aligned boundaries.
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(spacing: 0.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            FullScreenItem(item)
        }
    }
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)
View Aligned Behavior
SwiftUI also offers a ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior scroll behavior that will always settle on the geometry of individual views.
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(spacing: 10.0) {
        ForEach(items) { item in
            ItemView(item)
        }
    }
    .scrollTargetLayout()
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)
.safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, 20.0)
You configure which views should be used for settling using the View/scrollTargetLayout() modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout container like LazyVStack or HStack and each individual view in that layout will be considered for alignment.
Use types conforming to this protocol with the scrollTargetBehavior(_:) modifier.
Topics
Getting the scroll target behavior
static var paging: PagingScrollTargetBehavior
The scroll behavior that aligns scroll targets to container-based geometry.
Available when Self is PagingScrollTargetBehavior.
static var viewAligned: ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior
The scroll behavior that aligns scroll targets to view-based geometry.
Available when Self is ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.
static func viewAligned(limitBehavior: ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior) -> Self
The scroll behavior that aligns scroll targets to view-based geometry.
Available when Self is ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.
Updating the proposed target
func updateTarget(inout ScrollTarget, context: Self.TargetContext)
Updates the proposed target that a scrollable view should scroll to.
Required
typealias TargetContext
The context in which a scroll behavior updates the scroll target.
