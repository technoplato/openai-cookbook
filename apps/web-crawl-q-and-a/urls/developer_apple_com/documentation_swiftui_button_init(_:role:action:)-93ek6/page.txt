Initializer
init(_:role:action:)
Creates a button with a specified role that generates its label from a localized string key.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    role: ButtonRole?,
    action: @escaping () -> Void
)
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the button’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the button’s action.
role
An optional semantic role describing the button. A value of nil means that the button doesn’t have an assigned role.
action
The action to perform when the user triggers the button.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a button with a string variable, use init(_:role:action:) instead.
