Discussion
For example, this is how an adjustable action to navigate through pages could be added to a view.
var body: some View {
    PageControl()
        .accessibilityAdjustableAction { direction in
            switch direction {
            case .increment:
                // Go to next page
            case .decrement:
                // Go to previous page
            }
        }
}
