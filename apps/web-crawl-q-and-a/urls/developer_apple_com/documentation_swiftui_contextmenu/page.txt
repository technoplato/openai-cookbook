Overview
A context menu view allows you to present a situationally specific menu that enables taking actions relevant to the current task.
You can create a context menu by first defining a ContextMenu container with the controls that represent the actions people can take, and then using the contextMenu(_:) view modifier to apply the menu to a view.
The example below creates and applies a two item context menu container to a Text view. The Boolean value shouldShowMenu, which defaults to true, controls the availability of context menu:
private let menuItems = ContextMenu {
    Button {
        // Add this item to a list of favorites.
    } label: {
        Label("Add to Favorites", systemImage: "heart")
    }
    Button {
        // Open Maps and center it on this item.
    } label: {
        Label("Show in Maps", systemImage: "mappin")
    }
}


private struct ContextMenuMenuItems: View {
    @State private var shouldShowMenu = true


    var body: some View {
        Text("Turtle Rock")
            .contextMenu(shouldShowMenu ? menuItems : nil)
    }
}
