Clipboard
Enable people to move or duplicate items by issuing Copy and Paste commands.
Overview
When people issue standard Copy and Cut commands, they expect to move items to the system’s Clipboard, from which they can paste the items into another place in the same app or into another app. Your app can participate in this activity if you add view modifiers that indicate how to respond to the standard commands.
In your copy and paste modifiers, provide or accept types that conform to the Transferable protocol, or that inherit from the NSItemProvider class. When possible, prefer using transferable items.
Topics
Copying transferable items
func copyable<T>(() -> [T]) -> some View
Specifies a list of items to copy in response to the system’s Copy command.
func cuttable<T>(for: T.Type, action: () -> [T]) -> some View
Specifies an action that moves items to the Clipboard in response to the system’s Cut command.
func pasteDestination<T>(for: T.Type, action: ([T]) -> Void, validator: ([T]) -> [T]) -> some View
Specifies an action that adds validated items to a view in response to the system’s Paste command.
Copying items using item providers
func onCopyCommand(perform: (() -> [NSItemProvider])?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Copy command.
func onCutCommand(perform: (() -> [NSItemProvider])?) -> some View
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Cut command.
func onPasteCommand(of: [UTType], perform: ([NSItemProvider]) -> Void) -> some View

func onPasteCommand<Payload>(of: [UTType], validator: ([NSItemProvider]) -> Payload?, perform: (Payload) -> Void) -> some View
