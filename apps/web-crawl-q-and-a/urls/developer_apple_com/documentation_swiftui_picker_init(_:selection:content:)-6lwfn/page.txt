Initializer
init(_:selection:content:)
Creates a picker that generates its label from a localized string key.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    selection: Binding<SelectionValue>,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> Content
)
Available when Label is Text, SelectionValue conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
titleKey
A localized string key that describes the purpose of selecting an option.
selection
A binding to a property that determines the currently-selected option.
content
A view that contains the set of options.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a picker with a string variable, use init(_:selection:content:) instead.
