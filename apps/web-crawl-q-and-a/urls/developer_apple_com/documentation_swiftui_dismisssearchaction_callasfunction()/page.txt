func callAsFunction()
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it for you when you call the DismissSearchAction structure that you get from the Environment:
struct SearchedView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissSearch) private var dismissSearch


    var body: some View {
        Button("Cancel") {
            dismissSearch() // Implicitly calls dismissSearch.callAsFunction()
        }
    }
}
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
