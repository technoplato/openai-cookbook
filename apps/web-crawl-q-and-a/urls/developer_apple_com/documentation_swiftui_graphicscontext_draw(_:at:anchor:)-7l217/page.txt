func draw(
    _ image: Image,
    at point: CGPoint,
    anchor: UnitPoint = .center
)
Parameters
image
The Image to draw. Before drawing, the method converts the image to a GraphicsContext.ResolvedImage by calling resolve(_:).
point
A point within the rectangle of the resolved image to anchor to a point in the context.
anchor
A UnitPoint within the context to align the image with. The default is center.
Discussion
The current context state defines the full drawing operation. For example, the current transformation and clip shapes affect how SwiftUI draws the image.
