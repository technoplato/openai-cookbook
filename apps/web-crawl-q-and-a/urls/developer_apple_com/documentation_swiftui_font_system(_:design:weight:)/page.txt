static func system(
    _ style: Font.TextStyle,
    design: Font.Design? = nil,
    weight: Font.Weight? = nil
) -> Font
Discussion
Use this method to create a system font that has the specified properties. The following example creates a system font with the Font.TextStyle.body text style, a Font.Design.serif design, and a bold weight, and applies the font to a Text view using the font(_:) view modifier:
Text("Hello").font(.system(.body, design: .serif, weight: .bold))
The design and weight parameters are both optional. If you omit either, the system uses a default value for that parameter. The default values are typically Font.Design.default and regular, respectively, but might vary depending on the context.
