Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a button based on a configuration for a style with a custom appearance and custom interaction behavior.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(_ configuration: PrimitiveButtonStyleConfiguration)
Available when Label is PrimitiveButtonStyleConfiguration.Label.
Parameters
configuration
A configuration for a style with a custom appearance and custom interaction behavior.
Discussion
Use this initializer within the makeBody(configuration:) method of a PrimitiveButtonStyle to create an instance of the button that you want to style. This is useful for custom button styles that modify the current button style, rather than implementing a brand new style.
For example, the following style adds a red border around the button, but otherwise preserves the button’s current style:
struct RedBorderedButtonStyle: PrimitiveButtonStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Button(configuration)
            .border(Color.red)
    }
}
