struct ScrollViewProxy
Overview
You don’t create instances of ScrollViewProxy directly. Instead, your ScrollViewReader receives an instance of ScrollViewProxy in its content view builder. You use actions within this view builder, such as button and gesture handlers or the onChange(of:perform:) method, to call the proxy’s scrollTo(_:anchor:) method.
Topics
Performing scrolling
func scrollTo<ID>(ID, anchor: UnitPoint?)
Scans all scroll views contained by the proxy for the first with a child view with identifier id, and then scrolls to that view.
