Protocol
TimelineSchedule
A type that provides a sequence of dates for use as a schedule.

protocol TimelineSchedule
Overview
Types that conform to this protocol implement a particular kind of schedule by defining an entries(from:mode:) method that returns a sequence of dates. Use a timeline schedule type when you initialize a TimelineView. For example, you can create a timeline view that updates every second, starting from some startDate, using a periodic schedule returned by periodic(from:by:):
TimelineView(.periodic(from: startDate, by: 1.0)) { context in
    // View content goes here.
}
You can also create custom timeline schedules. The timeline view updates its content according to the sequence of dates produced by the schedule.
Topics
Getting built-in schedules
static var animation: AnimationTimelineSchedule
A pausable schedule of dates updating at a frequency no more quickly than the provided interval.
Available when Self is AnimationTimelineSchedule.
static func animation(minimumInterval: Double?, paused: Bool) -> AnimationTimelineSchedule
A pausable schedule of dates updating at a frequency no more quickly than the provided interval.
Available when Self is AnimationTimelineSchedule.
static var everyMinute: EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule
A schedule for updating a timeline view at the start of every minute.
Available when Self is EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule.
static func explicit<S>(S) -> ExplicitTimelineSchedule<S>
A schedule for updating a timeline view at explicit points in time.
static func periodic(from: Date, by: TimeInterval) -> PeriodicTimelineSchedule
A schedule for updating a timeline view at regular intervals.
Available when Self is PeriodicTimelineSchedule.
Getting a sequence of dates
func entries(from: Date, mode: Self.Mode) -> Self.Entries
Provides a sequence of dates starting around a given date.
Required
associatedtype Entries : Sequence
The sequence of dates within a schedule.
Required
Specifying a mode
typealias Mode
An alias for the timeline schedule update mode.
enum TimelineScheduleMode
A mode of operation for timeline schedule updates.
Supporting types
struct AnimationTimelineSchedule
