Protocol
NSViewControllerRepresentable
A wrapper that you use to integrate an AppKit view controller into your SwiftUI interface.
macOS 10.15+
protocol NSViewControllerRepresentable : View where Self.Body == Never
Overview
Use an NSViewControllerRepresentable instance to create and manage an NSViewController object in your SwiftUI interface. Adopt this protocol in one of your app’s custom instances, and use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view controller. The creation and update processes parallel the behavior of SwiftUI views, and you use them to configure your view controller with your app’s current state information. Use the teardown process to remove your view controller cleanly from your SwiftUI. For example, you might use the teardown process to notify other objects that the view controller is disappearing.
To add your view controller into your SwiftUI interface, create your NSViewControllerRepresentable instance and add it to your SwiftUI interface. The system calls the methods of your custom instance at appropriate times.
The system doesn’t automatically communicate changes occurring within your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface. When you want your view controller to coordinate with other SwiftUI views, you must provide a Coordinator instance to facilitate those interactions. For example, you use a coordinator to forward target-action and delegate messages from your view controller to any SwiftUI views.
Topics
Creating and updating the view controller
func makeNSViewController(context: Self.Context) -> Self.NSViewControllerType
Creates the view controller object and configures its initial state.
Required
func updateNSViewController(Self.NSViewControllerType, context: Self.Context)
Updates the state of the specified view controller with new information from SwiftUI.
Required
typealias Context
associatedtype NSViewControllerType : NSViewController
The type of view controller to present.
Required
Specifying a size
func sizeThatFits(ProposedViewSize, nsViewController: Self.NSViewControllerType, context: Self.Context) -> CGSize?
Given a proposed size, returns the preferred size of the composite view.
Required Default implementation provided.
Cleaning up the view controller
static func dismantleNSViewController(Self.NSViewControllerType, coordinator: Self.Coordinator)
Cleans up the presented view controller (and coordinator) in anticipation of its removal.
Required Default implementation provided.
Providing a custom coordinator object
func makeCoordinator() -> Self.Coordinator
Creates the custom object that you use to communicate changes from your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface.
Required Default implementation provided.
associatedtype Coordinator = Void
A type to coordinate with the view controller.
