Discussion
When you want all the SF Symbols in a part of your app’s user interface to use the same variant, use the symbolVariant(_:) modifier with a SymbolVariants value, like fill:
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    HStack(spacing: 20) {
        Image(systemName: "person")
        Image(systemName: "folder")
        Image(systemName: "gearshape")
        Image(systemName: "list.bullet")
    }


    HStack(spacing: 20) {
        Image(systemName: "person")
        Image(systemName: "folder")
        Image(systemName: "gearshape")
        Image(systemName: "list.bullet")
    }
    .symbolVariant(.fill) // Shows filled variants, when available.
}
A symbol that doesn’t have the specified variant remains unaffected. In the example above, the list.bullet symbol doesn’t have a filled variant, so the symbolVariant(_:) modifer has no effect.
If you apply the modifier more than once, its effects accumulate. Alternatively, you can apply multiple variants in one call:
Label("Airplane", systemImage: "airplane.circle.fill")


Label("Airplane", systemImage: "airplane")
    .symbolVariant(.circle)
    .symbolVariant(.fill)


Label("Airplane", systemImage: "airplane")
    .symbolVariant(.circle.fill)
All of the labels in the code above produce the same output:
You can apply all these variants in any order, but if you apply more than one shape variant, the one closest to the symbol takes precedence. For example, the following image uses the square shape:
Image(systemName: "arrow.left")
    .symbolVariant(.square) // This shape takes precedence.
    .symbolVariant(.circle)
    .symbolVariant(.fill)
To cause a symbol to ignore the variants currently in the environment, directly set the symbolVariants environment value to none using the environment(_:_:) modifer.
