struct RadialGradient
Overview
The gradient applies the color function as the distance from a center point, scaled to fit within the defined start and end radii. The gradient maps the unit space center point into the bounding rectangle of each shape filled with the gradient.
When using a radial gradient as a shape style, you can also use radialGradient(_:center:startRadius:endRadius:).
Topics
Creating a radial gradient
init(gradient: Gradient, center: UnitPoint, startRadius: CGFloat, endRadius: CGFloat)
Creates a radial gradient from a base gradient.
init(colors: [Color], center: UnitPoint, startRadius: CGFloat, endRadius: CGFloat)
Creates a radial gradient from a collection of colors.
init(stops: [Gradient.Stop], center: UnitPoint, startRadius: CGFloat, endRadius: CGFloat)
Creates a radial gradient from a collection of color stops.
