Initializer
init(_:id:content:)
Creates an instance that generates Rotor content by combining, in order, individual Rotor content for each element in the data given to this ForEach.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ data: Data,
    id: KeyPath<Data.Element, ID>,
    @AccessibilityRotorContentBuilder content: @escaping (Data.Element) -> Content
)
Available when Data conforms to RandomAccessCollection, ID conforms to Hashable, and Content conforms to AccessibilityRotorContent.
Parameters
data
The data that the ForEach instance uses to create views dynamically.
id
The key path to the provided data’s identifier.
content
The result builder that generates Rotor content for each data element.
Discussion
It’s important that the id of a data element doesn’t change, unless SwiftUI considers the data element to have been replaced with a new data element that has a new identity.
