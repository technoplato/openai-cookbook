enum ColorSchemeContrast
Overview
You receive a contrast value when you read the colorSchemeContrast environment value. The value tells you if a standard or increased contrast currently applies to the view. SwiftUI updates the value whenever the contrast changes, and redraws views that depend on the value. For example, the following Text view automatically updates when the user enables increased contrast:
@Environment(\.colorSchemeContrast) private var colorSchemeContrast


var body: some View {
    Text(colorSchemeContrast == .standard ? "Standard" : "Increased")
}
The user sets the contrast by selecting the Increase Contrast option in Accessibility > Display in System Preferences on macOS, or Accessibility > Display & Text Size in the Settings app on iOS. Your app can’t override the user’s choice. For information about using color and contrast in your app, see Color and Contrast.
