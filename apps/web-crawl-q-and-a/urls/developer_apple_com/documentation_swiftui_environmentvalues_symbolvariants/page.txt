var symbolVariants: SymbolVariants { get set }
Discussion
You set this environment value indirectly by using the symbolVariant(_:) view modifier. However, you access the environment variable directly using the environment(_:_:) modifier. Do this when you want to use the none variant to ignore the value that’s already in the environment:
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "heart")
    Image(systemName: "heart")
        .environment(\.symbolVariants, .none)
}
.symbolVariant(.fill)
