Instance Method
touchBar(_:)
Sets the Touch Bar content to be shown in the Touch Bar when applicable.
macOS 10.15+
func touchBar<Content>(_ touchBar: TouchBar<Content>) -> some View where Content : View
Parameters
touchBar
A collection of views that the Touch Bar displays.
Return Value
A view that contains the Touch Bar content.
Discussion
Use touchBar(_:) to provide a static set of views that are displayed by the Touch Bar when appropriate, depending on whether the view has focus.
The example below provides Touch Bar content in-line, that creates the content the Touch Bar displays:
func selectHearts() {/* ... */ }
func selectClubs() { /* ... */ }
func selectSpades() { /* ... */ }
func selectDiamonds() { /* ... */ }


TextField("TouchBar Demo", text: $placeholder)
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
    .focusable()
    .touchBar {
        Button("♥️ - Hearts", action: selectHearts)
        Button("♣️ - Clubs", action: selectClubs)
        Button("♠️ - Spades", action: selectSpades)
        Button("♦️ - Diamonds", action: selectDiamonds)
    }
