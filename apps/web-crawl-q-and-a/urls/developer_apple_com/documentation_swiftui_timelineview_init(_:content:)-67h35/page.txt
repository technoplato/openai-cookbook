Initializer
init(_:content:)
Creates a new timeline view that uses the given schedule.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ schedule: Schedule,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (TimelineView<Schedule, Content>.Context) -> Content
)
Available when Schedule conforms to TimelineSchedule and Content conforms to View.
Deprecated
Use init(_:content:) instead. The replacement initializer’s context closure takes a TimelineViewDefaultContext as its input rather than a TimelineView.Context to prevent introducing an unnecessary generic parameter dependency on the context type.
Parameters
schedule
A schedule that produces a sequence of dates that indicate the instances when the view should update. Use a type that conforms to TimelineSchedule, like everyMinute, or a custom timeline schedule that you define.
content
A closure that generates view content at the moments indicated by the schedule. The closure takes an input of type TimelineView.Context that includes the date from the schedule that prompted the update, as well as a TimelineView.Context.Cadence value that the view can use to customize its appearance.
