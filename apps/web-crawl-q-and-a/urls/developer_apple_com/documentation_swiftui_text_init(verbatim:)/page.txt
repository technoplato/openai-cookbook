Initializer
init(verbatim:)
Creates a text view that displays a string literal without localization.

init(verbatim content: String)
Parameters
content
A string to display without localization.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create a text view with a string literal without performing localization:
Text(verbatim: "pencil") // Displays the string "pencil" in any locale.
If you want to localize a string literal before displaying it, use the init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:) initializer instead. If you want to display a string variable, use the init(_:) initializer, which also bypasses localization.
