func bounds(of: NamedCoordinateSpace) -> CGRect?
Returns the given coordinate space’s bounds rectangle, converted to the local coordinate space.
Beta
func frame(in: CoordinateSpace) -> CGRect
Returns the container view’s bounds rectangle, converted to a defined coordinate space.
Deprecated
func frame(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> CGRect
Returns the container view’s bounds rectangle, converted to a defined coordinate space.
Beta
var size: CGSize
The size of the container view.
var safeAreaInsets: EdgeInsets
The safe area inset of the container view.
subscript<T>(Anchor<T>) -> T
Resolves the value of anchor to the container view.
func transform(in: some CoordinateSpaceProtocol) -> AffineTransform3D?
The container view’s 3D transform converted to a defined coordinate space. If the view does not have a well-defined transform, such as if it is affected by a projection transform, this function may return nil.

Beta
struct GeometryProxy3D
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space of the container view.
Beta
func coordinateSpace(NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View

Beta
struct PhysicalMetric
Provides access to a value in points that corresponds to the specified physical measurement.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetricsConverter
A physical metrics converter provides conversion between point values and their extent in 3D space, in the form of physical length measurements.
