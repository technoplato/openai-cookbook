Discussion
Use the openWindow environment value to get an OpenWindowAction instance for a given Environment. Then call the instance to open a window. You call the instance directly because it defines a callAsFunction(id:) method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can define a button that opens a new mail viewer window:
@main
struct Mail: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup(id: "mail-viewer") {
            MailViewer()
        }
    }
}


struct NewViewerButton: View {
    @Environment(\.openWindow) private var openWindow


    var body: some View {
        Button("Open new mail viewer") {
            openWindow(id: "mail-viewer")
        }
    }
}
You indicate which scene to open by providing one of the following:
A string identifier that you pass through the id parameter, as in the above example.
A value parameter that has a type that matches the type that you specify in the scene’s initializer.
Both an identifier and a value. This enables you to define multiple window groups that take input values of the same type like a UUID.
Use the first option to target either a WindowGroup or a Window scene in your app that has a matching identifier. For a WindowGroup, the system creates a new window for the group. If the window group presents data, the system provides the default value or nil to the window’s root view. If the targeted scene is a Window, the system orders it to the front.
Use the other two options to target a WindowGroup and provide a value to present. If the interface already has a window from the group that’s presenting the specified value, the system brings the window to the front. Otherwise, the system creates a new window and passes a binding to the specified value.
