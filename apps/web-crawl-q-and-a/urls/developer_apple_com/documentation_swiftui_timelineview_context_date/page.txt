let date: Date
Discussion
The first time a TimelineView closure receives this date, it might be in the past. For example, if you create an everyMinute schedule at 10:09:55, the schedule creates entries 10:09:00, 10:10:00, 10:11:00, and so on. In response, the timeline view performs an initial update immediately, at 10:09:55, but the context contains the 10:09:00 date entry. Subsequent entries arrive at their corresponding times.
