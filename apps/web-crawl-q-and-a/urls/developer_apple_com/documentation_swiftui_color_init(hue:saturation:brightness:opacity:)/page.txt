Initializer
init(hue:saturation:brightness:opacity:)
Creates a constant color from hue, saturation, and brightness values.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    hue: Double,
    saturation: Double,
    brightness: Double,
    opacity: Double = 1
)
Parameters
hue
A value in the range 0 to 1 that maps to an angle from 0° to 360° to represent a shade on the color wheel.
saturation
A value in the range 0 to 1 that indicates how strongly the hue affects the color. A value of 0 removes the effect of the hue, resulting in gray. As the value increases, the hue becomes more prominent.
brightness
A value in the range 0 to 1 that indicates how bright a color is. A value of 0 results in black, regardless of the other components. The color lightens as you increase this component.
opacity
An optional degree of opacity, given in the range 0 to 1. A value of 0 means 100% transparency, while a value of 1 means 100% opacity. The default is 1.
Discussion
This initializer creates a constant color that doesn’t change based on context. For example, it doesn’t have distinct light and dark appearances, unlike various system-defined colors, or a color that you load from an Asset Catalog with init(_:bundle:).
