Parameters
type
One of the keyboard types defined in the UIKeyboardType enumeration.
Discussion
Use keyboardType(_:) to specify the keyboard type to use for text entry. A number of different keyboard types are available to meet specialized input needs, such as entering email addresses or phone numbers.
The example below presents a TextField to input an email address. Setting the text field’s keyboard type to .emailAddress ensures the user can only enter correctly formatted email addresses.
TextField("someone@example.com", text: $emailAddress)
    .keyboardType(.emailAddress)
There are several different kinds of specialized keyboard types available though the UIKeyboardType enumeration. To specify the default system keyboard type, use .default.
