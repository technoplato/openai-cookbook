Type Method
distortionShader(_:maxSampleOffset:)
Returns a filter that applies shader as a geometric distortion effect on the location of each pixel.

static func distortionShader(
    _ shader: Shader,
    maxSampleOffset: CGSize
) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply as a distortion effect.
maxSampleOffset
The maximum distance in each axis between the returned source pixel position and the destination pixel position, for all source pixels.
Return Value
A new filter that applies the shader as a distortion effect.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a distortion effect it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] float2 name(float2 position, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the destination pixel applied to the shader. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader. The function should return the user-space coordinates of the corresponding source pixel.
