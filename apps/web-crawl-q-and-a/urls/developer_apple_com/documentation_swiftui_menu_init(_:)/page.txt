init(_ configuration: MenuStyleConfiguration)
Available when Label is MenuStyleConfiguration.Label and Content is MenuStyleConfiguration.Content.
Discussion
Use this initializer within the makeBody(configuration:) method of a MenuStyle instance to create an instance of the menu being styled. This is useful for custom menu styles that modify the current menu style.
For example, the following code creates a new, custom style that adds a red border around the current menu style:
struct RedBorderMenuStyle: MenuStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        Menu(configuration)
            .border(Color.red)
    }
}
