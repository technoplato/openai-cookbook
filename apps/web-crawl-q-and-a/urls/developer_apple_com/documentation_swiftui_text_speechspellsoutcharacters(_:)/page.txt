func speechSpellsOutCharacters(_ value: Bool = true) -> Text
Parameters
value
A Boolean value that when true indicates VoiceOver should speak text as individual characters. Defaults to true.
Discussion
Use this modifier when you want VoiceOver to speak text as individual letters, character by character. This is important for text that is not meant to be spoken together, like:
An acronym that isn’t a word, like APPL, spoken as “A-P-P-L”.
A number representing a series of digits, like 25, spoken as “two-five” rather than “twenty-five”.
