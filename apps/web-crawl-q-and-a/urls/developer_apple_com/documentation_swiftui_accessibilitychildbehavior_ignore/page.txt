static let ignore: AccessibilityChildBehavior
Discussion
Use this behavior when you want a view represented by a single accessibility element. The new accessibility element has no initial properties. So you will need to use other accessibility modifiers, such as accessibilityLabel(_:), to begin making it accessible.
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Button("Previous Page", action: goBack)
        Text("\(pageNumber)")
        Button("Next Page", action: goForward)
    }
    .accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)
    .accessibilityValue("Page \(pageNumber) of \(pages.count)")
    .accessibilityAdjustableAction { action in
        if action == .increment {
            goForward()
        } else {
            goBack()
        }
    }
}
Before using the ignorebehavior, consider using the combine behavior.
Note
A new accessibility element is always created.
