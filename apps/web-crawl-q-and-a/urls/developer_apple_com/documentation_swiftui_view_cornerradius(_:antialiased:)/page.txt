Instance Method
cornerRadius(_:antialiased:)
Clips this view to its bounding frame, with the specified corner radius.
iOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
iPadOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
Mac Catalyst 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
tvOS 13.0–17.0 Deprecated
watchOS 6.0–10.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0–1.0 Deprecated
func cornerRadius(
    _ radius: CGFloat,
    antialiased: Bool = true
) -> some View
Deprecated
Use clipShape(_:style:) or fill(style:) instead.
Parameters
antialiased
A Boolean value that indicates whether the rendering system applies smoothing to the edges of the clipping rectangle.
Return Value
A view that clips this view to its bounding frame with the specified corner radius.
Discussion
By default, a view’s bounding frame only affects its layout, so any content that extends beyond the edges of the frame remains visible. Use cornerRadius(_:antialiased:) to hide any content that extends beyond these edges while applying a corner radius.
The following code applies a corner radius of 25 to a text view:
Text("Rounded Corners")
    .frame(width: 175, height: 75)
    .foregroundColor(Color.white)
    .background(Color.black)
    .cornerRadius(25)
