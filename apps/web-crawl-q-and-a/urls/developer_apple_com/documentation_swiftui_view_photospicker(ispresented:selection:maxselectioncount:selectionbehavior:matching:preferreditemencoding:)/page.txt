) -> some View
Parameters
isPresented
The binding to whether the Photos picker should be shown.
selection
All items being shown and selected in the Photos picker.
maxSelectionCount
The maximum number of items that can be selected. Default is nil. Setting it to nil means maximum supported by the system.
selectionBehavior
The selection behavior of the Photos picker. Default is .default.
filter
Types of items that can be shown. Default is nil. Setting it to nil means all supported types can be shown.
preferredItemEncoding
The encoding disambiguation policy of selected items. Default is .automatic. Setting it to .automatic means the best encoding determined by the system will be used.
Discussion
The user explicitly grants access only to items they choose, so photo library access authorization is not needed.
