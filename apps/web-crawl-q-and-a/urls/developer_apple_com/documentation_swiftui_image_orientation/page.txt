enum Orientation
Overview
Many image formats such as JPEG include orientation metadata in the image data. In other cases, you can specify image orientation in code. Properly specifying orientation is often important both for displaying the image and for certain kinds of image processing.
In SwiftUI, you provide an orientation value when initializing an Image from an existing CGImage.
Topics
Getting image orientations
case up
A value that indicates the original pixel data matches the image’s intended display orientation.
case down
A value that indicates a 180° rotation of the image from the orientation of its original pixel data.
case left
A value that indicates a 90° counterclockwise rotation from the orientation of its original pixel data.
case right
A value that indicates a 90° clockwise rotation of the image from the orientation of its original pixel data.
Getting mirrored image orientation
case upMirrored
A value that indicates a horizontal flip of the image from the orientation of its original pixel data.
case downMirrored
A value that indicates a vertical flip of the image from the orientation of its original pixel data.
case leftMirrored
A value that indicates a 90° clockwise rotation and horizontal flip of the image from the orientation of its original pixel data.
case rightMirrored
A value that indicates a 90° counterclockwise rotation and horizontal flip from the orientation of its original pixel data.
