Instance Method
lineIntersection(_:eoFill:)
Returns a new shape with a line from this shape that overlaps the filled regions of the given shape.

func lineIntersection<T>(
    _ other: T,
    eoFill: Bool = false
) -> some Shape where T : Shape
Parameters
other
The shape to intersect.
eoFill
Whether to use the even-odd rule for determining which areas to treat as the interior of the shapes (if true), or the non-zero rule (if false).
Return Value
A new shape.
Discussion
The line of the resulting shape is the line of this shape that overlaps the filled region of other.
Intersected subpaths that are clipped create open subpaths. Closed subpaths that do not intersect other remain closed.
