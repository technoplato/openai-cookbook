init(
    horizontal: HorizontalAlignment,
    vertical: VerticalAlignment
)
Parameters
horizontal
The alignment on the horizontal axis.
vertical
The alignment on the vertical axis.
Discussion
SwiftUI provides a variety of built-in alignments that combine built-in HorizontalAlignment and VerticalAlignment guides. Use this initializer to create a custom alignment that makes use of a custom horizontal or vertical guide, or both.
For example, you can combine a custom vertical guide called firstThird with the built-in center guide, and use it to configure a ZStack:
ZStack(alignment: Alignment(horizontal: .center, vertical: .firstThird)) {
    // ...
}
For more information about creating custom guides, including the code that creates the custom firstThird alignment in the example above, see AlignmentID.
