Discussion
Use this style when there are two to five options. Consider using menu when there are more than five options.
For each option’s label, use sentence-style capitalization without ending punctuation, like a period or colon.
To apply this style to a picker, or to a view that contains pickers, use the pickerStyle(_:) modifier.
