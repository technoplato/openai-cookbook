Parameters

A file URL that points at an existing document.
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the openDocument action:
do {
    try await openDocument(at: url)
} catch {
    // Handle error
}
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
