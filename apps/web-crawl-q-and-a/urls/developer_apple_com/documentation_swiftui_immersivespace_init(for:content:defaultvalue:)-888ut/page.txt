Swift
Initializer
init(for:content:defaultValue:)
Creates an immersive space.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    for type: Data.Type = Data.self,
    @ImmersiveSpaceContentBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<Data>) -> Content,
    defaultValue: @escaping () -> Data
)
Parameters
type
The type of presented data this space accepts.
content
An immersive space content builder that defines the content of the space. The closure receives a binding to the value passed via openImmersiveSpace. The value of this binding will be persisted and restored during state restoration of the space.
defaultValue
A closure that returns a default value to present, which will be called in situations where the immersive space is presented without a value provided.
Discussion
The immersive space uses the specified content builder to form the content.
Your app invokes this initializer when it presents a value of the specified type using the openImmersiveSpace action.
