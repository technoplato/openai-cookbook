Instance Method
foregroundStyle(_:)
Sets a view’s foreground elements to use a given style.

func foregroundStyle<S>(_ style: S) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
style
The color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements. To indicate a specific value, use Color or image(_:sourceRect:scale:), or one of the gradient types, like linearGradient(colors:startPoint:endPoint:). To set a style that’s relative to the containing view’s style, use one of the semantic styles, like primary.
Return Value
A view that uses the given foreground style.
Discussion
Use this method to style foreground content like text, shapes, and template images (including symbols):
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "triangle.fill")
    Text("Hello, world!")
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 5)
        .frame(width: 40, height: 20)
}
.foregroundStyle(.teal)
The example above creates a row of teal foreground elements:
You can use any style that conforms to the ShapeStyle protocol, like the teal color in the example above, or the linearGradient(colors:startPoint:endPoint:) gradient shown below:
Text("Gradient Text")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .foregroundStyle(
        .linearGradient(
            colors: [.yellow, .blue],
            startPoint: .top,
            endPoint: .bottom
        )
    )
Tip
If you want to fill a single Shape instance with a style, use the fill(style:) shape modifier instead because it’s more efficient.
SwiftUI creates a context-dependent render for a given style. For example, a Color that you load from an asset catalog can have different light and dark appearances, while some styles also vary by platform.
Hierarchical foreground styles like ShapeStyle/secondary don’t impose a style of their own, but instead modify other styles. In particular, they modify the primary level of the current foreground style to the degree given by the hierarchical style’s name. To find the current foreground style to modify, SwiftUI looks for the innermost containing style that you apply with the foregroundStyle(_:) or the foregroundColor(_:) modifier. If you haven’t specified a style, SwiftUI uses the default foreground style, as in the following example:
VStack(alignment: .leading) {
    Label("Primary", systemImage: "1.square.fill")
    Label("Secondary", systemImage: "2.square.fill")
        .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
}
If you add a foreground style on the enclosing VStack, the hierarchical styling responds accordingly:
VStack(alignment: .leading) {
    Label("Primary", systemImage: "1.square.fill")
    Label("Secondary", systemImage: "2.square.fill")
        .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
}
.foregroundStyle(.blue)
When you apply a custom style to a view, the view disables the vibrancy effect for foreground elements in that view, or in any of its child views, that it would otherwise gain from adding a background material — for example, using the background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:) modifier. However, hierarchical styles applied to the default foreground don’t disable vibrancy.
