func accessibilityRotor<EntryModel, ID>(
    _ systemRotor: AccessibilitySystemRotor,
    entries: [EntryModel],
    entryID: KeyPath<EntryModel, ID>,
    entryLabel: KeyPath<EntryModel, String>
) -> some View where ID : Hashable
Parameters
systemRotor
The system-provided Rotor that will be overridden by this custom Rotor.
entries
An array of values that will be used to generate the entries of the Rotor.
entryID
Key path on the entry type that can be used to generate an identifier for the Entry. The identifiers must match up with identifiers in ForEach or explicit id calls within the ScrollView.
entryLabel
Key path on the entry type that can be used to get a user-visible label for every Rotor entry. This is used on macOS when the user opens the list of entries for the Rotor.
Discussion
An Accessibility Rotor is a shortcut for Accessibility users to quickly navigate to specific elements of the user interface, and optionally specific ranges of text within those elements.
Using this modifier requires that the Rotor be attached to a ScrollView, or an Accessibility Element directly within a ScrollView, such as a ForEach. When the user navigates to entries from this Rotor, SwiftUI will automatically scroll them into place as needed.
In the following example, a Message application creates a Rotor allowing users to navigate to the headings in its vertical stack of messages.
// `messageListItems` is a list of `MessageListItem`s
// that are either a `Message` or a heading, containing a `subject`
// and a `uuid`.
// `headingMessageListItems` is a filtered list of
// `messageListItems` containing just the headings.
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack {
        ForEach(messageListItems) { messageListItem in
            switch messageListItem {
                case .heading(let subject):
                    Text(subject)
                case .message(let message):
                    MessageView(message)
            }
        }
    }
}
.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)
.accessibilityRotor(
    .heading, entries: headingMessageListItems,
    entryID: \.uuid, label: \.subject
)

func accessibilityRotor<Content>(AccessibilitySystemRotor, entries: () -> Content) -> some View
Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor.
func accessibilityRotor<EntryModel>(AccessibilitySystemRotor, entries: [EntryModel], entryLabel: KeyPath<EntryModel, String>) -> some View
Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor.
func accessibilityRotor(AccessibilitySystemRotor, textRanges: [Range<String.Index>]) -> some View
Create an Accessibility Rotor replacing the specified system-provided Rotor. The Rotor will be attached to the current Accessibility element, and each entry will go the specified range of that element.
struct AccessibilitySystemRotor
Designates a Rotor that replaces one of the automatic, system-provided Rotors with a developer-provided Rotor.
