Instance Method
animation(_:)
Applies the given animation to all animatable values within this view.
iOS 13.0–15.0 Deprecated
iPadOS 13.0–15.0 Deprecated
macOS 10.15–12.0 Deprecated
Mac Catalyst 13.0–15.0 Deprecated
tvOS 13.0–15.0 Deprecated
watchOS 6.0–8.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0–1.0 Deprecated
func animation(_ animation: Animation?) -> some View
Deprecated
Use withAnimation(_:_:) or animation(_:value:) instead.
Parameters
animation
The animation to apply to animatable values within this view.
Return Value
A view that wraps this view and applies animation to all animatable values used within the view.
Discussion
Use this modifier on leaf views rather than container views. The animation applies to all child views within this view; calling animation(_:) on a container view can lead to unbounded scope.
