Instance Property
projectedValue
A projection of the observed object that provides bindings to its properties.
watchOS 7.0+
@MainActor
var projectedValue: ObservedObject<DelegateType>.Wrapper { get }
Available when DelegateType inherits NSObject, DelegateType conforms to ObservableObject, and DelegateType conforms to WKExtensionDelegate.
Discussion
Use the projected value to get a binding to a value that the delegate publishes. Access the projected value by prefixing the name of the delegate instance with a dollar sign ($). For example, you might publish a Boolean value in your extension delegate:
class MyExtensionDelegate: NSObject, WKExtensionDelegate, ObservableObject {
    @Published var isEnabled = false


    // ...
}
If you declare the delegate in your App using the WKExtensionDelegateAdaptor property wrapper, you can get the delegate that SwiftUI instantiates from the environment and access a binding to its published values from any view in your extension:
struct MyView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject private var extensionDelegate: MyExtensionDelegate


    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Enabled", isOn: $extensionDelegate.isEnabled)
    }
}
