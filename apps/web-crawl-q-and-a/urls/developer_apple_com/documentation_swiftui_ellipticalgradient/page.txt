struct EllipticalGradient
Overview
The gradient maps its coordinate space to the unit space square in which its center and radii are defined, then stretches that square to fill its bounding rect, possibly also stretching the circular gradient to have elliptical contours.
For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the view, filling its bounds:
EllipticalGradient(gradient: .init(colors: [.red, .yellow]))
When using an elliptical gradient as a shape style, you can also use ellipticalGradient(_:center:startRadiusFraction:endRadiusFraction:).
Topics
Creating an elliptical gradient
init(gradient: Gradient, center: UnitPoint, startRadiusFraction: CGFloat, endRadiusFraction: CGFloat)
Creates an elliptical gradient.
init(colors: [Color], center: UnitPoint, startRadiusFraction: CGFloat, endRadiusFraction: CGFloat)
Creates an elliptical gradient from a collection of colors.
init(stops: [Gradient.Stop], center: UnitPoint, startRadiusFraction: CGFloat, endRadiusFraction: CGFloat)
Creates an elliptical gradient from a collection of color stops.
