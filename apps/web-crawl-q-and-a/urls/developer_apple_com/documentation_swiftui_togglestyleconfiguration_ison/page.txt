Instance Property

@Binding
var isOn: Bool { get nonmutating set }
Discussion
Because this value is a Binding, you can both read and write it in your implementation of the makeBody(configuration:) method when defining a custom ToggleStyle. Access it through that method’s configuration parameter.
Read this value to set the appearance of the toggle. For example, you can choose between empty and filled circles based on the isOn value:
Image(systemName: configuration.isOn
    ? "checkmark.circle.fill"
    : "circle")
Write this value when the user takes an action that’s meant to change the state of the toggle. For example, you can toggle it inside the action closure of a Button instance:
Button {
    configuration.isOn.toggle()
} label: {
    // Draw the toggle.
}
