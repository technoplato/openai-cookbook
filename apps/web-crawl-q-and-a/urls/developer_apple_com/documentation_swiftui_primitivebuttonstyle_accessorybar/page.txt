This is the default button style for views in accessory toolbars, created with ToolbarItemPlacement.init(id:_), and for searchable scopes.
This style will also affect button style Toggles, as well as button style Pickers and Menus.

    Button("Button") {}


    Toggle("Toggle", isOn: $isToggleOn)
        .toggleStyle(.button)


    Picker("Picker", selection: $selection) {
        Text("Option 1").tag(0)
        Text("Option 2").tag(1)
    }

        Text("Option 1").tag(0)
