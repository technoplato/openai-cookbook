enum EditMode
Overview
You receive an optional binding to the edit mode state when you read the editMode environment value. The binding contains an EditMode value that indicates whether edit mode is active, and that you can use to change the mode. To learn how to read an environment value, see EnvironmentValues.
Certain built-in views automatically alter their appearance and behavior in edit mode. For example, a List with a ForEach that’s configured with the onDelete(perform:) or onMove(perform:) modifier provides controls to delete or move list items while in edit mode. On devices without an attached keyboard and mouse or trackpad, people can make multiple selections in lists only when edit mode is active.
You can also customize your own views to react to edit mode. The following example replaces a read-only Text view with an editable TextField, checking for edit mode by testing the wrapped value’s isEditing property:
@Environment(\.editMode) private var editMode
@State private var name = "Maria Ruiz"


var body: some View {
    Form {
        if editMode?.wrappedValue.isEditing == true {
            TextField("Name", text: $name)
        } else {
            Text(name)
        }
    }
    .animation(nil, value: editMode?.wrappedValue)
    .toolbar { // Assumes embedding this view in a NavigationView.
        EditButton()
    }
}
You can set the edit mode through the binding, or you can rely on an EditButton to do that for you, as the example above demonstrates. The button activates edit mode when the user taps it, and disables the mode when the user taps again.
