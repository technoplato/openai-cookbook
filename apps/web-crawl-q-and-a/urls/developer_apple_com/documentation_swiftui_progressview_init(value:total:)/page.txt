Initializer
init(value:total:)
Creates a progress view for showing determinate progress.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
tvOS 14.0+
watchOS 7.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<V>(
    value: V?,
    total: V = 1.0
) where Label == EmptyView, CurrentValueLabel == EmptyView, V : BinaryFloatingPoint
Available when Label conforms to View and CurrentValueLabel conforms to View.
Parameters
value
The completed amount of the task to this point, in a range of 0.0 to total, or nil if the progress is indeterminate.
total
The full amount representing the complete scope of the task, meaning the task is complete if value equals total. The default value is 1.0.
Discussion
If the value is non-nil, but outside the range of 0.0 through total, the progress view pins the value to those limits, rounding to the nearest possible bound. A value of nil represents indeterminate progress, in which case the progress view ignores total.
