Opens a window that’s associated with the specified identifier.

func callAsFunction(id: String)
Parameters
id
The identifier of the scene to present.
Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the openWindow action with an identifier:
openWindow(id: "message")
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
