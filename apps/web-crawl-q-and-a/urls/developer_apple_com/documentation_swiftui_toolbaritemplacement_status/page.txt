Discussion
Status items are informational in nature, and don’t represent an action that can be taken by the user. For example, a message that indicates the time of the last communication with the server to check for new messages.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places status items in the center of the toolbar.
In iOS and iPadOS, the system places status items in the center of the bottom toolbar.
