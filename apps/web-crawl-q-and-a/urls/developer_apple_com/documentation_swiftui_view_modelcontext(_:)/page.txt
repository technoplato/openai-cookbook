func modelContext(_ modelContext: ModelContext) -> some View
Parameters
modelContext
The model context to set in this view’s environment.
Discussion
In this example, the RecipesList view sets a model context to use for all of its content:
@Model class Recipe { ... }
...
RecipesList()
    .modelContext(myContext)
The environment’s modelContext property will be assigned myContext. All implicit model context operations in this view, such as Query properties, will use the environment’s context.
