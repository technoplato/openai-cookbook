Initializer
init(_:rowContent:)
Creates a list that computes its views on demand over a constant range.

@MainActor
init<RowContent>(
    _ data: Range<Int>,
    @ViewBuilder rowContent: @escaping (Int) -> RowContent
) where Content == ForEach<Range<Int>, Int, RowContent>, RowContent : View
Available when SelectionValue is Never and Content conforms to View.
Parameters
data
A constant range of data to populate the list.
rowContent
A view builder that creates the view for a single row of the list.
Discussion
This instance only reads the initial value of data and doesn’t need to identify views across updates. To compute views on demand over a dynamic range, use init(_:id:rowContent:).
