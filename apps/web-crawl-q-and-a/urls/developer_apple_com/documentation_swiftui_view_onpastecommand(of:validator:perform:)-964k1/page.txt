Instance Method
onPasteCommand(of:validator:perform:)
Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Paste command with items that you validate.
macOS 10.15–14.0 Deprecated
func onPasteCommand<Payload>(
    of supportedTypes: [String],
    validator: @escaping ([NSItemProvider]) -> Payload?,
    perform payloadAction: @escaping (Payload) -> Void
) -> some View
Deprecated
Use onPasteCommand(of:validator:perform:) instead.
Parameters
supportedTypes
The uniform type identifiers that describe the types of content this view can accept through a paste action. If the Clipboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.
validator
A handler that validates the command. This handler receives items from the Clipboard with the types you specify in the supportedTypes parameter. Use this handler to decide whether the items are valid and preprocess them for the action closure. If you return nil instead, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.
payloadAction
The action to perform when the Paste command triggers.
Return Value
A view that triggers action when the system Paste command is invoked, validating the Paste command with validator.
Discussion
Pass an array of uniform type identifiers to the supportedTypes parameter. Place the higher priority types closer to the beginning of the array. The Clipboard items that the validator closure receives have the most preferred type out of all the types the source supports.
For example, if your app can handle plain text and rich text, but you prefer rich text, place the rich text type first in the array. If rich text is available when the paste action occurs, the validator closure passes that rich text along.
