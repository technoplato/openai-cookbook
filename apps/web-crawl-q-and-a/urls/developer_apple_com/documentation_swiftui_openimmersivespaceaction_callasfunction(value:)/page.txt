Parameters

The value to present.
Discussion
The call returns either once the immersive space is presented, or once an error occurred.
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the openImmersiveSpace action:
await openImmersiveSpace(value: solarSystem.ID)
If an immersive space is already presented, calling this action has no effect. Dismiss any currently presented immersive space prior to presenting another one. Otherwise, the system creates a new immersive space and passes its root view a binding to the specified value.
For best performance, use lightweight data for the presentation value. For structured model values that conform to Identifiable, the value’s identifier makes a good presentation value.
