static let cancellationAction: ToolbarItemPlacement
Discussion
Cancellation actions dismiss the modal interface without taking any action, usually by tapping or clicking a Cancel button.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places cancellationAction items on the trailing edge of the sheet but places them before any confirmationAction items.
In iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS, the system places cancellationAction items on the leading edge of the navigation bar.
