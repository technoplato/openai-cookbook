Instance Method
size(_:)
Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).

Transforming a shape
func trim(from: CGFloat, to: CGFloat) -> some Shape
Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.
func transform(CGAffineTransform) -> TransformedShape<Self>
Applies an affine transform to this shape.
func size(width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) -> some Shape
Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size (width, height). This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
func scale(CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint) -> ScaledShape<Self>
Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
func scale(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint) -> ScaledShape<Self>
Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
func rotation(Angle, anchor: UnitPoint) -> RotatedShape<Self>
Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.
func offset(CGSize) -> OffsetShape<Self>
Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified size.
func offset(CGPoint) -> OffsetShape<Self>
Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
func offset(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) -> OffsetShape<Self>
Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
