Discussion
Use this guide to align the centers of views:
The following code generates the image above using a VStack:
struct HorizontalAlignmentCenter: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 0) {
            Color.red.frame(width: 1)
            Text("Center").font(.title).border(.gray)
            Color.red.frame(width: 1)
        }
    }
}
