func toolbarColorScheme(
    _ colorScheme: ColorScheme?,
    for bars: ToolbarPlacement...
) -> some View
Parameters

The preferred color scheme of the background of the bar.
bars

Discussion
The preferred color scheme flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS. Pass in a value of nil to match the current system’s color scheme.
This examples shows a view that renders the navigation bar with a blue background and dark color scheme:
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbarBackground(.blue)
            .toolbarColorScheme(.dark)
    }
    // other tabs...
}
You can provide multiple ToolbarPlacement instances to customize multiple bars at once.
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbarBackground(
                .blue, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
            .toolbarColorScheme(
                .dark, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
Note that the provided color scheme is only respected while a background is visible in the requested bar. As the background becomes visible, the bar transitions from the color scheme of the app to the requested color scheme. You can ensure that the color scheme is always respected by specifying that the background of the bar always be visible.
NavigationView {
    ContentView()
        .toolbarBackground(.visible)
        .toolbarColorScheme(.dark)
}
Depending on the specified bars, the requested color scheme may not be able to be fullfilled.
