func privacySensitive(_ sensitive: Bool = true) -> some View
Discussion
SwiftUI redacts views marked with this modifier when you apply the privacy redaction reason.
struct BankAccountView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Account #")


            Text(accountNumber)
                .font(.headline)
                .privacySensitive() // Hide only the account number.
        }
    }
}
