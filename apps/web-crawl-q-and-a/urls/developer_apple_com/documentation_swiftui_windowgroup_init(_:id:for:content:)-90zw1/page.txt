Swift
Initializer
init(_:id:for:content:)
Creates a data-presenting window group with a localized title string and an identifier.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<D, C>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    id: String,
    for type: D.Type,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<D?>) -> C
) where Content == PresentedWindowContent<D, C>, D : Decodable, D : Encodable, D : Hashable, C : View
Available when Content conforms to View.
Parameters
titleKey
The title key to use for the group’s title.
id
A string that uniquely identifies the window group. Identifiers must be unique among the window groups in your app.
type
The type of presented data this window group accepts.
content
A closure that creates the content for each instance of the group. The closure receives a binding to the value that you pass into the openWindow action when you open the window. SwiftUI automatically persists and restores the value of this binding as part of the state restoration process.
Discussion
The window group uses the specified content as a template to create each window in the group.
The system uses the title to distinguish the window group in the user interface, such as in the name of commands associated with the group.
SwiftUI creates a window from the group when you present a value of the specified type using the openWindow action.
