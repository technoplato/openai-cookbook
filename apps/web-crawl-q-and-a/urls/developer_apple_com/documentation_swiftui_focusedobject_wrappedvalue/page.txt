Discussion
This property provides primary access to the value’s data. However, you don’t access wrappedValue directly. Instead, you use the property variable created with the FocusedObject attribute.
When a mutable value changes, the new value is immediately available. However, a view displaying the value is updated asynchronously and may not show the new value immediately.
