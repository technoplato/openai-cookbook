static let automatic: MenuOrder
Discussion
On iOS, this order resolves to fixed for menus presented within scrollable content. Pickers that use the menu style also default to fixed order. In all other cases, menus default to priority order.
On macOS, tvOS and watchOS, the automatic order always resolves to fixed order.
