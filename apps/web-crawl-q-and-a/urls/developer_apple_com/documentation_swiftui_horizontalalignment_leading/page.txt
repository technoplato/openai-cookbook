Discussion
Use this guide to align the leading edges of views. For a device that uses a left-to-right language, the leading edge is on the left:
The following code generates the image above using a VStack:
struct HorizontalAlignmentLeading: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
            Color.red.frame(width: 1)
            Text("Leading").font(.title).border(.gray)
            Color.red.frame(width: 1)
        }
    }
}
