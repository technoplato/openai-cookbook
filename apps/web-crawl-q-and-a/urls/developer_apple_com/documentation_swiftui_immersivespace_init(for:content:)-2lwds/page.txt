Initializer
init(for:content:)
A convenience for creating an immersive space using view-based content. Creates the immersive space for a specified type of presented data.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<V>(
    for type: Data.Type,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<Data?>) -> V
) where Content == ImmersiveSpaceViewContent<V>, V : View
Available when Content conforms to ImmersiveSpaceContent, Data conforms to Decodable, Data conforms to Encodable, and Data conforms to Hashable.
Parameters
type
The type of presented data this immersive space accepts.
content
A view builder that defines the content for each instance of the immersive space. The closure receives a binding to the value passed via openImmersiveSpace. The system automatically persists and restores the value of this binding during state restoration.
Discussion
The immersive space uses the specified view as a template to form the content of the space.
Your app invokes this initializer when it presents a value of the specified type using the openImmersiveSpace action.
