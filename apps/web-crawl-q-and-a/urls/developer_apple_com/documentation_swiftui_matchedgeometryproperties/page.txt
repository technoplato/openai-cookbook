Synchronizing geometries
func matchedGeometryEffect<ID>(id: ID, in: Namespace.ID, properties: MatchedGeometryProperties, anchor: UnitPoint, isSource: Bool) -> some View
Defines a group of views with synchronized geometry using an identifier and namespace that you provide.
protocol GeometryEffect
An effect that changes the visual appearance of a view, largely without changing its ancestors or descendants.
struct Namespace
A dynamic property type that allows access to a namespace defined by the persistent identity of the object containing the property (e.g. a view).
func geometryGroup() -> some View
Isolates the geometry (e.g. position and size) of the view from its parent view.
