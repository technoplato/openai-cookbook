Type Method

static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat
Required
Parameters
context
The context of the view that you apply the alignment guide to. The context gives you the view’s dimensions, as well as the values of other alignment guides that apply to the view, including both built-in and custom guides. You can use any of these values, if helpful, to calculate the value for your custom guide.
Return Value
The offset of the guide from the origin in the view’s coordinate space.
Discussion
Implement this method when you create a type that conforms to the AlignmentID protocol. Use the method to calculate the default offset of the corresponding alignment guide. SwiftUI interprets the value that you return as an offset in the coordinate space of the view that’s being laid out. For example, you can use the context to return a value that’s one-third of the height of the view:
private struct FirstThirdAlignment: AlignmentID {
    static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
        context.height / 3
    }
}
You can override the default value that this method returns for a particular guide by adding the alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:) view modifier to a particular view.
