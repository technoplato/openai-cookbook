Initializer
init(_:white:opacity:)
Creates a constant grayscale color.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ colorSpace: Color.RGBColorSpace = .sRGB,
    white: Double,
    opacity: Double = 1
)
Parameters
colorSpace
The profile that specifies how to interpret the color for display. The default is Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGB.
white
A value that indicates how white the color is, with higher values closer to 100% white, and lower values closer to 100% black.
opacity
An optional degree of opacity, given in the range 0 to 1. A value of 0 means 100% transparency, while a value of 1 means 100% opacity. The default is 1.
Discussion
This initializer creates a constant color that doesn’t change based on context. For example, it doesn’t have distinct light and dark appearances, unlike various system-defined colors, or a color that you load from an Asset Catalog with init(_:bundle:).
A standard sRGB color space clamps the white component to a range of 0 to 1, but SwiftUI colors use an extended sRGB color space, so you can use component values outside that range. This makes it possible to create colors using the Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGB or Color.RGBColorSpace.sRGBLinear color space that make full use of the wider gamut of a diplay that supports Color.RGBColorSpace.displayP3.
