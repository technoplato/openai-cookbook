Available when Label conforms to View and CurrentValueLabel conforms to View.
Discussion
You can use this initializer within the makeBody(configuration:) method of a ProgressViewStyle to create an instance of the styled progress view. This is useful for custom progress view styles that only modify the current progress view style, as opposed to implementing a brand new style. Because this modifier style can’t know how the current style represents progress, avoid making assumptions about the view’s contents, such as whether it uses bars or other shapes.
The following example shows a style that adds a rounded pink border to a progress view, but otherwise preserves the progress view’s current style:
struct PinkBorderedProgressViewStyle: ProgressViewStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        ProgressView(configuration)
            .padding(4)
            .border(.pink, width: 3)
            .cornerRadius(4)
    }
}
Note
Progress views in widgets don’t apply custom styles.
