Instance Method
fileWrapper(snapshot:configuration:)
Serializes a document snapshot to a file wrapper.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func fileWrapper(
    snapshot: Self.Snapshot,
    configuration: Self.WriteConfiguration
) throws -> FileWrapper
Required
Parameters
snapshot
The document snapshot to save.
configuration
Information about a file that already exists for the document, if any.
Return Value
The destination to serialize the document contents to. The value can be a newly created FileWrapper or an update of the one provided in the configuration input.
Discussion
To store a document — for example, in response to a Save command — SwiftUI begins by calling the snapshot(contentType:) method to get a copy of the document data in its current state. Then SwiftUI passes that snapshot to this method, where you serialize it and create or modify a file wrapper with the serialized data:
func fileWrapper(snapshot: Snapshot, configuration: WriteConfiguration) throws -> FileWrapper {
    let data = try JSONEncoder().encode(snapshot)
    return FileWrapper(regularFileWithContents: data)
}
SwiftUI disables document edits during the snapshot to ensure that the document’s data remains coherent, but reenables edits during the serialization operation.
Note
SwiftUI calls this method on a background thread. Don’t make user interface changes from that thread.
