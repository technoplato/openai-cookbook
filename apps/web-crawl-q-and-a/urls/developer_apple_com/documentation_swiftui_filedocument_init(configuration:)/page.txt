Initializer
init(configuration:)
Creates a document and initializes it with the contents of a file.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(configuration: Self.ReadConfiguration) throws
Required
Parameters
configuration
Information about the file that you read document data from.
Discussion
SwiftUI calls this initializer when someone opens a file type that matches one of those that your document type supports. Use the file property of the configuration input to get document’s data. Deserialize the data, and store it in your document’s data structure:
init(configuration: ReadConfiguration) throws {
    guard let data = configuration.file.regularFileContents
    else { /* Throw an error. */ }
    model = try JSONDecoder().decode(Model.self, from: data)
}
The above example assumes that you define Model to contain the document’s data, that Model conforms to the Codable protocol, and that you store a model property of that type inside your document.
Note
SwiftUI calls this method on a background thread. Don’t make user interface changes from that thread.
