Parameters
text
The Text view to draw. Before drawing, the method converts the view to GraphicsContext.ResolvedText by calling resolve(_:).
rect

Discussion
The current context state defines the full drawing operation. For example, the current transformation and clip shapes affect how SwiftUI draws the text.
