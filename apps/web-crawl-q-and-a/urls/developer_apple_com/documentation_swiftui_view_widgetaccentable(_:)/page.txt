func widgetAccentable(_ accentable: Bool = true) -> some View
Parameters
accentable
A Boolean value that indicates whether to add the view and its subviews to the accented group.
Discussion
When the system renders the widget using the WidgetKit/WidgetRenderingMode/accented mode, it divides the widget’s view hierarchy into two groups: the accented group and the default group. It then applies a different color to each group.
When applying the colors, the system treats the widget’s views as if they were template images. It ignores the view’s color — rendering the new colors based on the view’s alpha channel.
To control your view’s appearance, add the widgetAccentable(_:) modifier to part of your view’s hierarchy. If the accentable parameter is true, the system adds that view and all of its subviews to the accent group. It puts all other views in the default group.
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Text("MON")
            .font(.caption)
            .widgetAccentable()
        Text("6")
            .font(.title)
        }
    }
}
Important
After you call widgetAccentable(true) on a view moving it into the accented group, calling widgetAccentable(false) on its subviews doesn’t move the subviews back into the default group.
