func gridCellColumns(_ count: Int) -> some View
Parameters
count
The number of columns that the view should consume when placed in a grid row.
Return Value
A view that occupies the specified number of columns in a grid row.
Discussion
By default, each view that you put into the content closure of a GridRow corresponds to exactly one column of the grid. Apply the gridCellColumns(_:) modifier to a view that you want to span more than one column, as in the following example of a typical macOS configuration view:
Grid(alignment: .leadingFirstTextBaseline) {
    GridRow {
        Text("Regular font:")
            .gridColumnAlignment(.trailing)
        Text("Helvetica 12")
        Button("Select...") { }
    }
    GridRow {
        Text("Fixed-width font:")
        Text("Menlo Regular 11")
        Button("Select...") { }
    }
    GridRow {
        Color.clear
            .gridCellUnsizedAxes([.vertical, .horizontal])
        Toggle("Use fixed-width font for new documents", isOn: $isOn)
            .gridCellColumns(2) // Span two columns.
    }
}
The Toggle in the example above spans the column that contains the font names and the column that contains the buttons:
Important
When you tell a cell to span multiple columns, the grid changes the merged cell to use anchor alignment, rather than the usual alignment guides. For information about the behavior of anchor alignment, see gridCellAnchor(_:).
As a convenience you can cause a view to span all of the Grid columns by placing the view directly in the content closure of the Grid, outside of a GridRow, and omitting the modifier. To do the opposite and include more than one view in a cell, group the views using an appropriate layout container, like an HStack, so that they act as a single view.
