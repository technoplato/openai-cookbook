Instance Method
onChange(of:perform:)
Adds an action to perform when the given value changes.

func onChange<V>(
    of value: V,
    perform action: @escaping (V) -> Void
) -> some View where V : Equatable
Deprecated
Use onChange(of:initial:_:) or onChange(of:initial:_:) instead. The trailing closure in each case takes either zero or two input parameters, compared to this method which takes one.
Be aware that the replacements have slightly different behvavior. This modifier’s closure captures values that represent the state before the change. The new modifiers capture values that correspond to the new state. The new behavior makes it easier to perform updates that rely on values other than the one that caused the modifier’s closure to run.
Discussion
Use this modifier to trigger a side effect when a value changes, like the value associated with an Environment value or a Binding. For example, you can clear a cache when you notice that a scene moves to the background:
struct MyScene: Scene {
    @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
    @StateObject private var cache = DataCache()


    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MyRootView()
        }
        .onChange(of: scenePhase) { newScenePhase in
            if newScenePhase == .background {
                cache.empty()
            }
        }
    }
}
The system may call the action closure on the main actor, so avoid long-running tasks in the closure. If you need to perform such tasks, detach an asynchronous background task:
.onChange(of: scenePhase) { newScenePhase in
    if newScenePhase == .background {
        Task.detached(priority: .background) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
The system passes the new value into the closure. If you need the old value, capture it in the closure.

Deprecated
func focusable(Bool, onFocusChange: (Bool) -> Void) -> some View
Specifies if the view is focusable and, if so, adds an action to perform when the view comes into focus.
Deprecated
func onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace, perform: (HoverPhase) -> Void) -> some View
Adds an action to perform when the pointer enters, moves within, and exits the view’s bounds.
Deprecated
