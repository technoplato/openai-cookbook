var authorizationController: AuthorizationController { get }
Discussion
For example, you can perform authorization requests when the user taps a button:
struct AuthorizationControllerExample: View {
    @Environment(\.authorizationController) private var authorizationController


    var body: some View {
        Button("Sign In") {
            Task {
                do {
                    async let requests = authorizationRequests() // defined elsewhere
                    let result = try await authorizationController
                        .performRequests(requests)


                    switch result {
                    // code to handle the authorization result
                    }
                } catch {
                    // code to handle the authorization error
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
