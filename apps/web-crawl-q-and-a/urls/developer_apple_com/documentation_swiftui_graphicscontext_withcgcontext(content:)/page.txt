Instance Method
withCGContext(content:)
Provides a Core Graphics context that you can use as a proxy to draw into this context.
iOS 15.0+

Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func withCGContext(content: (CGContext) throws -> Void) rethrows
Parameters
content
A closure that receives a CGContext that you use to perform drawing operations, just like you draw into a GraphicsContext instance. Any filters, blend mode settings, clip masks, and other state set before calling withCGContext(content:) apply to drawing operations in the Core Graphics context as well. Any state you set on the Core Graphics context is lost when the closure returns. Accessing the Core Graphics context after the closure returns produces undefined behavior.
Discussion
Use this method to use existing drawing code that relies on Core Graphics primitives.
