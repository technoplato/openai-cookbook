Instance Method
makeCoordinator()
Creates the custom object that you use to communicate changes from your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface.
macOS 10.15+
@MainActor
func makeCoordinator() -> Self.Coordinator
Required Default implementation provided.
Discussion
Implement this method if changes to your view controller might affect other parts of your app. In your implementation, create a custom Swift instance that can communicate with other parts of your interface. For example, you might provide an instance that binds its variables to SwiftUI properties, causing the two to remain synchronized. If your view controller doesn’t interact with other parts of your app, providing a coordinator is unnecessary.
SwiftUI calls this method before calling the makeNSViewController(context:) method. The system provides your coordinator instance either directly or as part of a context structure when calling the other methods of your representable instance.
