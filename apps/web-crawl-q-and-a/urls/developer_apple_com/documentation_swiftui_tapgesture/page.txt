struct TapGesture
Overview
To recognize a tap gesture on a view, create and configure the gesture, and then add it to the view using the gesture(_:including:) modifier. The following code adds a tap gesture to a Circle that toggles the color of the circle:
struct TapGestureView: View {
    @State private var tapped = false


    var tap: some Gesture {
        TapGesture(count: 1)
            .onEnded { _ in self.tapped = !self.tapped }
    }


    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(self.tapped ? Color.blue : Color.red)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100, alignment: .center)
            .gesture(tap)
    }
}
