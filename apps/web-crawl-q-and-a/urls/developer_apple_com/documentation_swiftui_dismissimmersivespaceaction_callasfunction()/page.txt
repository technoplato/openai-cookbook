Instance Method
callAsFunction()
Dismisses the currently opened immersive space.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
@MainActor
func callAsFunction() async
Discussion
The call returns once the space is dismissed.
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the dismissImmersiveSpace action:
await dismissImmersiveSpace()
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
