Instance Method
keyboardShortcut(_:modifiers:localization:)
Defines a keyboard shortcut for opening new scene windows.
macOS 13.0+
func keyboardShortcut(
    _ key: KeyEquivalent,
    modifiers: EventModifiers = .command,
    localization: KeyboardShortcut.Localization = .automatic
) -> some Scene
Parameters
key
The key equivalent the user presses to present the scene.
modifiers
The modifier keys required to perform the shortcut.
localization
The localization style to apply to the shortcut.
Return Value
A scene that can be presented with a keyboard shortcut.
Discussion
A scene’s keyboard shortcut is bound to the command it adds for creating new windows (in the case of WindowGroup and DocumentGroup) or bringing a singleton window forward (in the case of Window and, on macOS, Settings). Pressing the keyboard shortcut is equivalent to selecting the menu command.
In cases where a command already has a keyboard shortcut, the scene’s keyboard shortcut is used instead. For example, WindowGroup normally creates a File > New Window menu command whose keyboard shortcut is ⌘N. The following code changes it to ⌥⌘N:
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
}
.keyboardShortcut("n", modifiers: [.option, .command])
Localization
Provide a localization value to specify how this shortcut should be localized.
Given that key is always defined in relation to the US-English keyboard layout, it might be hard to reach on different international layouts. For example the shortcut ⌘[ works well for the US layout but is hard to reach for German users, where [ is available by pressing ⌥5, making users type ⌥⌘5. The automatic keyboard shortcut remapping re-assigns the shortcut to an appropriate replacement, ⌘Ö in this case.
Providing the option custom disables the automatic localization for this shortcut to tell the system that internationalization is taken care of in a different way.
