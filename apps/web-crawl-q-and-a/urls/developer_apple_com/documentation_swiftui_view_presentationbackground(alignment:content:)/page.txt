    alignment: Alignment = .center,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> V
) -> some View where V : View
Parameters

The alignment that the modifier uses to position the implicit ZStack that groups the background views. The default is center.
content
The view to use as the background of the presentation.
Discussion
The following example uses a yellow view as the sheet background:
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false


    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView()
                .presentationBackground {
                    Color.yellow
                }
        }
    }
}
The presentationBackground(alignment:content:) modifier differs from the background(alignment:content:) modifier in several key ways. A presentation background:
Automatically fills the entire presentation.
Allows views behind the presentation to show through translucent areas of the content.
