Initializer
init(_:content:animation:)
Cycles through the given phases continuously, updating the content using the view builder closure that you supply.

init(
    _ phases: some Sequence<Phase>,
    @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Phase) -> Content,
    animation: @escaping (Phase) -> Animation? = { _ in .default }
)
Parameters
phases
Phases defining the states that will be cycled through. This sequence must not be empty. If an empty sequence is provided, a visual warning will be displayed in place of this view, and a warning will be logged.
content
A view builder closure.
animation
A closure that returns the animation to use when transitioning to the next phase. If nil is returned, the transition will not be animated.
Discussion
The phases that you provide define the individual values that will be animated between.
When the view first appears, the the first phase is provided to the content closure. The animator then immediately animates to the second phase, using an animation returned from the animation closure. This continues until the last phase is reached, after which the animator loops back to the beginning.

init(some Sequence<Phase>, trigger: some Equatable, content: (Phase) -> Content, animation: (Phase) -> Animation?)
