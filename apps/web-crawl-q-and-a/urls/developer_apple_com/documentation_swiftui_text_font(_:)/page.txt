func font(_ font: Font?) -> Text
Parameters
font
The font to use when displaying this text.
Return Value
Text that uses the font you specify.
Discussion
Use font(_:) to apply a specific font to an individual Text View, or all of the text views in a container.
In the example below, the first text field has a font set directly, while the font applied to the following container applies to all of the text views inside that container:
VStack {
    Text("Font applied to a text view.")
        .font(.largeTitle)


    VStack {
        Text("These two text views have the same font")
        Text("applied to their parent view.")
    }
    .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .light, design: .default))
}
