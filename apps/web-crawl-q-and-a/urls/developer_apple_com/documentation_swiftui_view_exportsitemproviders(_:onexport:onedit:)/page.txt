Instance Method
exportsItemProviders(_:onExport:onEdit:)
Exports a read-write item provider for consumption by shortcuts, quick actions, and services.
macOS 12.0+
func exportsItemProviders(
    _ contentTypes: [UTType],
    onExport: @escaping () -> [NSItemProvider],
    onEdit: @escaping ([NSItemProvider]) -> Bool
) -> some View
Parameters
contentTypes
The types of content that the view supports exporting and importing. An empty array means the view does not currently support exporting.
onExport
A closure that will be called on request of the items by the shortcut or service.
onEdit
A closure that will be called after the shortcut or service completes with its output data. This should replace the selected subpart that was exported with onExport. Return false to indicate that there was a failure to receive the items.
Discussion
If the associated view supports selection, the exported item should reflect that selected subpart.
