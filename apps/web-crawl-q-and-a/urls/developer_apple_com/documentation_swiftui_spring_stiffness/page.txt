var stiffness: Double { get }
Discussion
Increasing the stiffness reduces the number of oscillations and will reduce the settling duration. Decreasing the stiffness increases the the number of oscillations and will increase the settling duration.

var bounce: Double
How bouncy the spring is.
Beta
var damping: Double
Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.
Beta
var dampingRatio: Double
The amount of drag applied, as a fraction of the amount needed to produce critical damping.
Beta
var duration: TimeInterval
The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring.
Beta
var mass: Double
The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.
Beta
var response: Double
The stiffness of the spring, defined as an approximate duration in seconds.
Beta
var settlingDuration: TimeInterval
The estimated duration required for the spring system to be considered at rest.
