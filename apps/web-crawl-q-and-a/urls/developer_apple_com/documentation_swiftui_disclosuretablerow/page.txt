struct DisclosureTableRow<Label, Content> where Label : TableRowContent, Content : TableRowContent, Label.TableRowValue == Content.TableRowValue
Overview
A disclosure group row consists of a label row that is always visible, and some content rows that are conditionally visible depending on the state. Toggling the control will flip the state between “expanded” and “collapsed”.
In the following example, a disclosure group has allDevices as the label row, and exposes its expanded state with the bound property, expanded. Upon toggling the disclosure control, the user can update the expanded state which will in turn show or hide the three content rows for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
private struct DeviceStats: Identifiable {
    // ...
}
@State private var expanded: Bool = true
@State private var allDevices: DeviceStats = /* ... */
@State private var iPhone: DeviceStats = /* ... */
@State private var iPad: DeviceStats = /* ... */
@State private var Mac: DeviceStats = /* ... */


var body: some View {
    Table(of: DeviceStats.self) {
        // ...
    } rows: {
        DisclosureTableRow(allDevices, isExpanded: $expanded) {
            TableRow(iPhone)
            TableRow(iPad)
            TableRow(Mac)
        }
    }
}
