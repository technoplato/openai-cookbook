iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    selection: Binding<Color>,
    supportsOpacity: Bool = true
)
Available when Label is Text.

selection
A Binding to the variable that displays the selected Color.
supportsOpacity
A Boolean value that indicates whether the color picker allows adjustments to the selected color’s opacity; the default is true.
Discussion
Use ColorPicker to create a color well that your app uses to allow the selection of a Color. The example below creates a color well using a Binding to a property stored in a settings object and title you provide:
final class Settings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var alignmentGuideColor =
        Color(.sRGB, red: 0.98, green: 0.9, blue: 0.2)
}


struct FormattingControls: View {
    @State private var settings = Settings()


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Other formatting controls.
            ColorPicker("Alignment Guides",
                selection: $settings.alignmentGuideColor
            )
        }
    }
}
