Instance Method

Sets the behavior of this view for different layout directions.
iOS 17.0+ Beta

func layoutDirectionBehavior(_ behavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior) -> some View
Parameters
behavior
A LayoutDirectionBehavior value that indicates whether this view should mirror in a particular layout direction. By default, views will adjust their layouts automatically in a right-to-left context and do not need to be mirrored.
Return Value
A view that conditionally mirrors its contents horizontally in a given layout direction.
Discussion
Use layoutDirectionBehavior(_:) when you need the system to horizontally mirror the contents of the view when presented in a layout direction.
To override the layout direction for a specific view, use the environment(_:_:) view modifier to explicitly override the layoutDirection environment value for the view.
