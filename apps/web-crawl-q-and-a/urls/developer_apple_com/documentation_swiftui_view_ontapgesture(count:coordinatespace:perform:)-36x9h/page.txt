Instance Method
onTapGesture(count:coordinateSpace:perform:)
Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a tap gesture, and provides the action with the location of the interaction.
iOS 16.0–17.0 Deprecated
iPadOS 16.0–17.0 Deprecated
macOS 13.0–14.0 Deprecated
Mac Catalyst 16.0–17.0 Deprecated
watchOS 9.0–10.0 Deprecated
visionOS 1.0–1.0 Deprecated
func onTapGesture(
    count: Int = 1,
    coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace = .local,
    perform action: @escaping (CGPoint) -> Void
) -> some View
Deprecated
Use onTapGesture(count:coordinateSpace:perform:) instead.
Parameters
count
The number of taps or clicks required to trigger the action closure provided in action. Defaults to 1.
coordinateSpace
The coordinate space in which to receive location values. Defaults to CoordinateSpace.local.
action
The action to perform. This closure receives an input that indicates where the interaction occurred.
Discussion
Use this method to perform the specified action when the user clicks or taps on the modified view count times. The action closure receives the location of the interaction.
Note
If you create a control that’s functionally equivalent to a Button, use ButtonStyle to create a customized button instead.
The following code adds a tap gesture to a Circle that toggles the color of the circle based on the tap location.
struct TapGestureExample: View {
    @State private var location: CGPoint = .zero


    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(self.location.y > 50 ? Color.blue : Color.red)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100, alignment: .center)
            .onTapGesture { location in
                self.location = location
            }
    }
}
