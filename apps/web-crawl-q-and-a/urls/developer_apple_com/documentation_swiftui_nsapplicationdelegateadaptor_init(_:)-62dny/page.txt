Swift
Initializer
init(_:)
Creates an AppKit app delegate adaptor using an observable delegate.
macOS 14.0+ Beta
@MainActor
init(_ delegateType: DelegateType.Type = DelegateType.self)
Available when DelegateType inherits NSObject, DelegateType conforms to NSApplicationDelegate, and DelegateType conforms to Observable.
Parameters
delegateType
The type of application delegate that you define in your app, which conforms to the NSApplicationDelegate and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocols.
Discussion
Call this initializer indirectly by creating a property with the NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor property wrapper from inside your App declaration:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor private var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate


    var body: some Scene { ... }
}
SwiftUI initializes the delegate and manages its lifetime, calling it as needed to handle application delegate callbacks.
SwiftUI invokes this method when your app delegate conforms to the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Observation/Observable-swift.protocol protocol. In this case, SwiftUI automatically places the delegate in the Environment. You can access such a delegate from any scene or view in your app using the Environment property wrapper:
@Environment(MyAppDelegate.self) private var appDelegate
If your delegate isn’t observable, SwiftUI invokes the init(_:) initializer rather than this one, and doesn’t put the delegate instance in the environment.
