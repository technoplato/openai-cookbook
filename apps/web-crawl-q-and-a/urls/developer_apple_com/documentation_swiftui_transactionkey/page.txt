protocol TransactionKey
Overview
You can create custom transaction values by extending the Transaction structure with new properties. First declare a new transaction key type and specify a value for the required defaultValue property:
private struct MyTransactionKey: TransactionKey {
    static let defaultValue = false
}
The Swift compiler automatically infers the associated Value type as the type you specify for the default value. Then use the key to define a new transaction value property:
extension Transaction {
    var myCustomValue: Bool {
        get { self[MyTransactionKey.self] }
        set { self[MyTransactionKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}
Clients of your transaction value never use the key directly. Instead, they use the key path of your custom transaction value property. To set the transaction value for a change, wrap that change in a call to withTransaction:
withTransaction(\.myCustomValue, true) {
    isActive.toggle()
}
To set it for a view and all its subviews, add the View/transaction(_:_:) view modifier to that view:
MyView()
    .transaction(\.myCustomValue, true)
To use the value from inside MyView or one of its descendants, use the transaction(_:) view modifier:
MyView()
    .transaction { transaction in
        if transaction.myCustomValue {
            transaction.animation = .default.repeatCount(3)
        }
    }
