protocol CoordinateSpaceProtocol
Overview
All geometric properties of a view, including size, position, and transform, are defined within the local coordinate space of the view’s parent. These values can be converted into other coordinate spaces by passing types conforming to this protocol into functions such as GeometryProxy.frame(in:).
For example, a named coordinate space allows you to convert the frame of a view into the local coordinate space of an ancestor view by defining a named coordinate space using the coordinateSpace(_:) modifier, then passing that same named coordinate space into the frame(in:) function.
VStack {
    GeometryReader { geometryProxy in
        let distanceFromTop = geometryProxy.frame(in: "container").origin.y
        Text("This view is \(distanceFromTop) points from the top of the VStack")
    }
    .padding()
}
.coordinateSpace(.named("container"))
You don’t typically create types conforming to this protocol yourself. Instead, use the system-provided .global, .local, and .named(_:) implementations.
Topics
Getting built-in coordinate spaces
static var immersiveSpace: NamedCoordinateSpace
Available when Self is NamedCoordinateSpace.
static var global: GlobalCoordinateSpace
The global coordinate space at the root of the view hierarchy.
Available when Self is GlobalCoordinateSpace.
static var local: LocalCoordinateSpace
The local coordinate space of the current view.
Available when Self is LocalCoordinateSpace.
static func named(some Hashable) -> NamedCoordinateSpace
Creates a named coordinate space using the given value.
Available when Self is NamedCoordinateSpace.
static var scrollView: NamedCoordinateSpace
The named coordinate space that is added by the system for the innermost containing scroll view.
Available when Self is NamedCoordinateSpace.
static func scrollView(axis: Axis) -> Self
The named coordinate space that is added by the system for the innermost containing scroll view that allows scrolling along the provided axis.
Available when Self is NamedCoordinateSpace.
Getting the resolved coordinate space
var coordinateSpace: CoordinateSpace
The resolved coordinate space.
Required
Supporting types

Measuring a view
struct GeometryReader
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
struct GeometryReader3D
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
Beta
struct GeometryProxy
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space (for anchor resolution) of the container view.
struct GeometryProxy3D
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space of the container view.
Beta
func coordinateSpace(NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View
Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.
Beta
enum CoordinateSpace
A resolved coordinate space created by CoordinateSpaceProtocol.
struct PhysicalMetric
Provides access to a value in points that corresponds to the specified physical measurement.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetricsConverter
A physical metrics converter provides conversion between point values and their extent in 3D space, in the form of physical length measurements.
