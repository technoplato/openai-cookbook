) -> some View
Parameters

The preferred visibility of the bar.
bars
The bars to update the visibility of or automatic if empty.
Discussion
The preferred visibility flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS.
This examples shows a view that hides the navigation bar.
NavigationView {
    ContentView()
        .toolbar(.hidden)
}
You can provide multiple ToolbarPlacement instances to hide multiple bars at once.
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbar(
                .hidden, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
Note
In macOS, if you provide ToolbarCommands to the scene of your app, this modifier disables the toolbar visibility command while the value of the modifier is not automatic.
Depending on the specified bars, the requested visibility may not be able to be fullfilled.
