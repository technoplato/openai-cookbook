Overview
You can create and use a custom detent with built-in detents.
extension PresentationDetent {
    static let bar = Self.custom(BarDetent.self)
    static let small = Self.height(100)
    static let extraLarge = Self.fraction(0.75)
}


private struct BarDetent: CustomPresentationDetent {
    static func height(in context: Context) -> CGFloat? {
        max(44, context.maxDetentValue * 0.1)
    }
}


struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showSettings = false
    @State private var selectedDetent = PresentationDetent.bar


    var body: some View {
        Button("View Settings") {
            showSettings = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSettings) {
            SettingsView(selectedDetent: $selectedDetent)
                .presentationDetents(
                    [.bar, .small, .medium, .large, .extraLarge],
                    selection: $selectedDetent)
        }
    }
}
