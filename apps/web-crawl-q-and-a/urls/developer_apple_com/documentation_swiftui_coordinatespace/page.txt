enum CoordinateSpace
Overview
You don’t typically use CoordinateSpace directly. Instead, use the static properties and functions of CoordinateSpaceProtocol such as .global, .local, and .named(_:).
Topics
Getting coordinate spaces
case global
The global coordinate space at the root of the view hierarchy.
case local
The local coordinate space of the current view.
case named(AnyHashable)
A named reference to a view’s local coordinate space.
Testing a space
var isGlobal: Bool
var isLocal: Bool

Measuring a view
struct GeometryReader
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
struct GeometryReader3D
A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.
Beta
struct GeometryProxy
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space (for anchor resolution) of the container view.
struct GeometryProxy3D
A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space of the container view.
Beta
func coordinateSpace(NamedCoordinateSpace) -> some View
Assigns a name to the view’s coordinate space, so other code can operate on dimensions like points and sizes relative to the named space.
Beta
protocol CoordinateSpaceProtocol
A frame of reference within the layout system.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetric
Provides access to a value in points that corresponds to the specified physical measurement.
Beta
struct PhysicalMetricsConverter
A physical metrics converter provides conversion between point values and their extent in 3D space, in the form of physical length measurements.
