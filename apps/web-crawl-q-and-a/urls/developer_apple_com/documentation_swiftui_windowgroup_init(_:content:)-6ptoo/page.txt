init(
    _ title: Text,
    @ViewBuilder content: () -> Content
)
Parameters
title
The Text view to use for the group’s title.
content
A closure that creates the content for each instance of the group.
Discussion
The window group uses the given view as a template to form the content of each window in the group. The system uses the title to distinguish the window group in the user interface, such as in the name of commands associated with the group.
Important
The system ignores any text styling that you apply to the Text view title, like bold or italics. However, you can use the formatting controls that the view offers, like for localization, dates, and numerical representations.
