Discussion
Apply this style to a Gauge or to a view hierarchy that contains gauges using the gaugeStyle(_:) modifier:
Gauge(value: batteryLevel, in: 0...100) {
    Text("Battery Level")
}
.gaugeStyle(.accessoryLinearCapacity)
If you provide minimumValueLabel and maximumValueLabel parameters when you create the gauge, they appear on leading and trailing edges of the bar, respectively. The label appears above the gauge, and the currentValueLabel appears below.
