Swift
Initializer
init(_:value:)
Creates a navigation link that presents the view corresponding to a codable value, with a text label that the link generates from a localized string key.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init<P>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    value: P?
) where Label == Text, P : Decodable, P : Encodable, P : Hashable
Available when Label conforms to View and Destination is Never.
Parameters
titleKey
A localized string that describes the view that this link presents.
value
An optional value to present. When someone taps or clicks the link, SwiftUI stores a copy of the value. Pass a nil value to disable the link.
Discussion
When someone activates the navigation link that this initializer creates, SwiftUI looks for a nearby navigationDestination(for:destination:) view modifier with a data input parameter that matches the type of this initializer’s value input, with one of the following outcomes:
If SwiftUI finds a matching modifier within the view hierarchy of an enclosing NavigationStack, it pushes the modifier’s corresponding destination view onto the stack.
If SwiftUI finds a matching modifier in the view hierarchy of a stack that’s in a later column of a NavigationSplitView, it puts the modifier’s destination view as the first and only item onto the stack while preserving the stack’s root view.
If there’s no matching modifier, but the link appears in a List with selection inside a leading column of a navigation split view, the link updates the selection, which might affect the appearance of a trailing view. For an example of this, see NavigationLink.
In other cases, the link doesn’t do anything.
Because this initializer takes a value that conforms to the Codable protocol, you ensure that a NavigationPath that includes this link can produce a non-nil value for its codable property. This helps to make the path serializable.
