Topics
Getting 2D position
var startLocation: CGPoint
The location of the drag gesture’s first event.
var location: CGPoint
The location of the drag gesture’s current event.
var predictedEndLocation: CGPoint
A prediction, based on the current drag velocity, of where the final location will be if dragging stopped now.
var translation: CGSize
The total translation from the start of the drag gesture to the current event of the drag gesture.
var predictedEndTranslation: CGSize
A prediction, based on the current drag velocity, of what the final translation will be if dragging stopped now.
Getting 3D position
var startLocation3D: Point3D
The 3D start location of the drag gesture.
Beta
var location3D: Point3D
The 3D location of the drag gesture.
Beta
var predictedEndLocation3D: Point3D
A prediction of where the final location would be if dragging stopped now, based on the current drag velocity.
Beta
var translation3D: Vector3D
The translation of the drag gesture from startLocation3D to location3D.
Beta
var predictedEndTranslation3D: Vector3D
A prediction of what the final translation would be if dragging stopped now, based on the current drag velocity.
Beta
var startInputDevicePose3D: Pose3D?
The starting 3D pose of the device driving the drag, if one exists.
Beta
var inputDevicePose3D: Pose3D?
The 3D pose of the device driving the drag, if one exists.
Beta
Handling changes over time
var time: Date
