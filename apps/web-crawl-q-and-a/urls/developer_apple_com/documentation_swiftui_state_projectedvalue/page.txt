var projectedValue: Binding<Value> { get }
Discussion
Use the projected value to get a Binding to the stored value. The binding provides a two-way connection to the stored value. To access the projectedValue, prefix the property variable with a dollar sign ($).
In the following example, PlayerView projects a binding of the state property isPlaying to the PlayButton view using $isPlaying. That enables the play button to both read and write the value:
struct PlayerView: View {
    var episode: Episode
    @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false


    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(episode.title)
                .foregroundStyle(isPlaying ? .primary : .secondary)
            PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying)
        }
    }
}
