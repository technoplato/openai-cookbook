Discussion
For example, an elliptical gradient centered on the top-leading corner of the view, with some extra green area:
EllipticalGradient(
    stops: [
        .init(color: .blue, location: 0.0),
        .init(color: .green, location: 0.9),
        .init(color: .green, location: 1.0),
    ],
    center: .topLeading,
    startRadiusFraction: 0,
    endRadiusFraction: 1)
stops: The colors and their parametric locations.
center: The center of the circle, in [0, 1] coordinates.
startRadiusFraction: The start radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
endRadiusFraction: The end radius value, as a fraction between zero and one. Zero maps to the center point, one maps to the diameter of the unit circle.
