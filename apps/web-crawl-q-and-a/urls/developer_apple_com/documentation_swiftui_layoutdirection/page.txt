enum LayoutDirection
Overview
SwiftUI supports both left-to-right and right-to-left directions for laying out content to support different languages and locales. The system sets the value based on the user’s locale, but you can also use the environment(_:_:) modifier to override the direction for a view and its child views:
MyView()
    .environment(\.layoutDirection, .rightToLeft)
You can also read the layoutDirection environment value to find out which direction applies to a particular environment. However, in many cases, you don’t need to take any action based on this value. SwiftUI horizontally flips the x position of each view within its parent, so layout calculations automatically produce the desired effect for both modes without any changes.
