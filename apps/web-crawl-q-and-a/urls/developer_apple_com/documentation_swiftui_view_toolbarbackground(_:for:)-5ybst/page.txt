func toolbarBackground<S>(
    _ style: S,
    for bars: ToolbarPlacement...
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
style
The style to display as the background of the bar.
bars
The bars to use the style for or automatic if empty.
Discussion
The preferred style flows up to the nearest container that renders a bar. This could be a NavigationView or TabView in iOS, or the root view of a WindowGroup in macOS. This example shows a view that renders the navigation bar with a blue background and dark color scheme.
NavigationView {
    ContentView()
        .toolbarBackground(.white)
        .toolbarColorScheme(.dark)
}
You can provide multiple ToolbarPlacement instances to customize multiple bars at once.
TabView {
    NavigationView {
        ContentView()
            .toolbarBackground(
                .blue, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
            .toolbarColorScheme(
                .dark, for: .navigationBar, .tabBar)
    }
}
When used within a TabView, the specified style will be preferred while the tab is currently active. You can use a Group to specify the same preferred background for every tab.
TabView {
    Group {
        MainView()
        SettingsView()
    }
    .toolbarBackground(.blue, for: .tabBar)
}
Depending on the specified bars, the requested style may not be able to be fullfilled.
