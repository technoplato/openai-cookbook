struct LayoutProperties
Overview
This structure contains configuration information that’s applicable to a layout container. For example, the stackOrientation value indicates the layout’s primary axis, if any.
You can use an instance of this type to characterize a custom layout container, which is a type that conforms to the Layout protocol. Implement the protocol’s layoutProperties property to return an instance. For example, you can indicate that your layout has a vertical stack orientation:
extension BasicVStack {
    static var layoutProperties: LayoutProperties {
        var properties = LayoutProperties()
        properties.stackOrientation = .vertical
        return properties
    }
}
If you don’t implement the property in your custom layout, the protocol provides a default implementation that returns a LayoutProperties instance with default values.
