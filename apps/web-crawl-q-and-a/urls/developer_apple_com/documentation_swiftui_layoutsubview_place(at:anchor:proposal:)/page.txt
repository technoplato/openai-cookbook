func place(
    at position: CGPoint,
    anchor: UnitPoint = .topLeading,
    proposal: ProposedViewSize
)
Parameters
position
The place where the anchor of the subview should appear in its container view, relative to container’s bounds.
anchor
The unit point on the subview that appears at position. You can use a built-in point, like center, or you can create a custom UnitPoint.
proposal
A proposed size for the subview. In SwiftUI, views choose their own size, but can take a size proposal from their parent view into account when doing so.
Discussion
Call this method from your implementation of the Layout protocol’s placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:) method for each subview arranged by the layout. Provide a position within the container’s bounds where the subview should appear, and an anchor that indicates which part of the subview appears at that point.
Include a proposed size that the subview can take into account when sizing itself. To learn the subview’s size for a given proposal before calling this method, you can call the dimensions(in:) or sizeThatFits(_:) method on the subview with the same proposal. That enables you to know subview sizes before committing to subview positions.
Important
Call this method only from within your Layout type’s implementation of the placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:) method.
If you call this method more than once for a subview, the last call takes precedence. If you don’t call this method for a subview, the subview appears at the center of its layout container and uses the layout container’s size proposal.
