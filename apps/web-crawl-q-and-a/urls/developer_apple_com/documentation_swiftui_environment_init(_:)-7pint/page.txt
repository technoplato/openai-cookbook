Initializer
init(_:)
Creates an environment property to read an observable object from the environment.

init(_ objectType: Value.Type) where Value : AnyObject, Value : Observable
Parameters
objectType
The type of the Observable object to read from the environment.
Discussion
Important
This initializer only accepts objects conforming to the Observable protocol. For reading environment objects that conform to ObservableObject, use EnvironmentObject instead.
Don’t call this initializer directly. Instead, declare a property with the Environment property wrapper, passing the object’s type to the wrapper (using this syntax, the object type can be omitted from the end of property declaration):
@Observable final class Profile { ... }


struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(Profile.self) private var currentProfile


    // ...
}
Warning
If no object has been set in the view’s environment, this property will issue a fatal error when accessed. To safely check for the existence of an environment object, initialize the environment property with an optional object type instead.
SwiftUI automatically updates any parts of MyView that depend on the property when the associated environment object changes.
You can’t modify the environment object using a property like this. Instead, use the View/environment(_:)-9b2sq view modifier on a view to set an object for a view hierarchy.
