The following example shows how to add an accessibilityQuickAction(style:content:) to play and pause music.
@State private var isPlaying = false


var body: some View {
    PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying)
        .contentShape(.focusEffect, Circle())
        .accessibilityQuickAction(style: .outline) {
            Button(isPlaying ? "Pause" : "Play") {
                isPlaying.toggle()
            }
        }
