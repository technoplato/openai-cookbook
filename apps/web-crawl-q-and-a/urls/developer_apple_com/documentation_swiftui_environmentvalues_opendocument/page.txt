Instance Property
openDocument
An action in the environment that presents an existing document.
macOS 13.0+
var openDocument: OpenDocumentAction { get }
Discussion
Use the openDocument environment value to get the instance of the OpenDocumentAction structure for a given Environment. Then call the instance to present an existing document. You call the instance directly because it defines a callAsFunction(at:) method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can create a button that opens the document at the specified URL:
struct OpenDocumentButton: View {
    var url: URL
    @Environment(\.openDocument) private var openDocument


    var body: some View {
        Button(url.deletingPathExtension().lastPathComponent) {
            Task {
                do {
                    try await openDocument(at: url)
                } catch {
                    // Handle error
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
The above example uses a do-catch statement to handle any errors that the open document action might throw. It also places the action inside a task and awaits the result because the action operates asynchronously.
To present an existing document, your app must define a DocumentGroup that handles the content type of the specified file. For a document that’s already open, the system brings the existing window to the front. Otherwise, the system opens a new window.
