static let multicolor: SymbolRenderingMode
Discussion
The layers may be filled with their own inherent styles, or the foreground style. For example, you can render a filled exclamation mark triangle in its inherent colors, with yellow for the triangle and white for the exclamation mark:
Image(systemName: "exclamationmark.triangle.fill")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.multicolor)
