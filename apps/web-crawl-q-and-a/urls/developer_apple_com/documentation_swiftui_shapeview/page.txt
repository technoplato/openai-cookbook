Use this type with the drawing methods on Shape to apply multiple fills and/or strokes to a shape. For example, the following code applies a fill and stroke to a capsule shape:
Capsule()
    .fill(.yellow)
    .stroke(.blue, lineWidth: 8)
Topics
Getting the shape
var shape: Self.Content
The shape that this type draws and provides for other drawing operations.
Required
associatedtype Content : Shape
The type of shape this can provide.
Required
Modify the shape
func fill<S>(S, style: FillStyle) -> FillShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self>
Fills this shape with a color or gradient.
func stroke<S>(S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self>
Traces the outline of this shape with a color or gradient.
func stroke<S>(S, lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self>
Traces the outline of this shape with a color or gradient.
func strokeBorder<S>(S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeBorderShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self>
Returns a view that’s the result of insetting this view by half of its style’s line width.
Available when Content conforms to InsettableShape.
func strokeBorder<S>(S, lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeBorderShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self>
Returns a view that’s the result of filling an inner stroke of this view with the content you supply.
Available when Content conforms to InsettableShape.
