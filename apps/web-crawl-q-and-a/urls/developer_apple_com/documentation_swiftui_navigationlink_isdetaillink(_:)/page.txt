Instance Method
isDetailLink(_:)
Sets the navigation link to present its destination as the detail component of the containing navigation view.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func isDetailLink(_ isDetailLink: Bool) -> some View
Available when Label conforms to View and Destination conforms to View.
Parameters
isDetailLink
A Boolean value that specifies whether this link presents its destination as the detail component when used in a multi-column navigation view.
Return Value
A view that applies the specified detail link behavior.
Discussion
This method sets the behavior when the navigation link is used in a NavigationSplitView, or a multi-column navigation view, such as one using ColumnNavigationViewStyle.
For example, in a two-column navigation split view, if isDetailLink is true, triggering the link in the sidebar column sets the contents of the detail column to be the link’s destination view. If isDetailLink is false, the link navigates to the destination view within the primary column.
If you do not set the detail link behavior with this method, the behavior defaults to true.
The isDetailLink modifier only affects view-destination links. Links that present data values always search for a matching navigation destination beginning in the column that contains the link.
