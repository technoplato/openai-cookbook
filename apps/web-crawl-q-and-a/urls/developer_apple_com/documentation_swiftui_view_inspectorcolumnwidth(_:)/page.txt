Instance Method
inspectorColumnWidth(_:)
Sets a fixed, preferred width for the inspector containing this view when presented as a trailing column.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
func inspectorColumnWidth(_ width: CGFloat) -> some View
Parameters
width
The preferred fixed width for the inspector if presented as a trailing column.
Discussion
Apply this modifier on the content of a inspector(isPresented:content:) to specify a fixed preferred width for the trailing column. Use navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min:ideal:max:) if you need to specify a flexible width.
The following example shows an editor interface with an inspector, which when presented as a trailing-column, has a fixed width of 225 points. The example also uses interactiveDismissDisabled(_:) to prevent the inspector from being collapsed by user action like dragging a divider.
MyEditorView()
    .inspector {
        TextTraitsInspectorView()
            .inspectorColumnWidth(225)
            .interactiveDismissDisabled()
    }
Note
A fixed width does not prevent the user collapsing the inspector on macOS. See interactiveDismissDisabled(_:).
