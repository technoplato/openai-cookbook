) where S : StringProtocol
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
title
A string that describes the purpose of the toggle.
isOn
Whether the toggle is on or off.
intent
The AppIntent to be performed.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the title similar to init(_:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a toggle with a localized string key, use Toggle/init(_:isOn:intent:) instead.
