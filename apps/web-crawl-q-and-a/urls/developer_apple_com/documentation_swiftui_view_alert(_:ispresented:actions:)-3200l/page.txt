Instance Method
alert(_:isPresented:actions:)
Presents an alert when a given condition is true, using a localized string key for the title.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func alert<A>(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    isPresented: Binding<Bool>,
    @ViewBuilder actions: () -> A
) -> some View where A : View
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the localized string that describes the title of the alert.
isPresented
A binding to a Boolean value that determines whether to present the alert. When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to false and dismisses.
actions
A ViewBuilder returning the alert’s actions.
Discussion
In the example below, a login form conditionally presents an alert by setting the didFail state variable. When the form sets the value to to true, the system displays an alert with an “OK” action.
struct Login: View {
    @State private var didFail = false


    var body: some View {
        LoginForm(didFail: $didFail)
            .alert(
                "Login failed.",
                isPresented: $didFail
            ) {
                Button("OK") {
                    // Handle the acknowledgement.
                }
            }
    }
}
All actions in an alert dismiss the alert after the action runs. The default button is shown with greater prominence. You can influence the default button by assigning it the defaultAction keyboard shortcut.
The system may reorder the buttons based on their role and prominence.
If no actions are present, the system includes a standard “OK” action. No default cancel action is provided. If you want to show a cancel action, use a button with a role of cancel.
On iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, alerts only support controls with labels that are Text. Passing any other type of view results in the content being omitted.
This modifier creates a Text view for the title on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
