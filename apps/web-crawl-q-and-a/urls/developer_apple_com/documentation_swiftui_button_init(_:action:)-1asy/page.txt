Initializer
init(_:action:)
Creates a button that generates its label from a localized string key.
iOS 13.0+
iPadOS 13.0+
macOS 10.15+
Mac Catalyst 13.0+
tvOS 13.0+
watchOS 6.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    action: @escaping () -> Void
)
Available when Label is Text.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the button’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the button’s action.
action
The action to perform when the user triggers the button.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a button with a string variable, use init(_:action:) instead.
