) -> some WidgetConfiguration where D : Sendable, R : Sendable
Parameters
task
The type of task the action responds to.
action
The closure that is called when the system provides a task matching the provided task.
Discussion
When the system wakes your app or extension for one or more background tasks, it will call any actions associated with matching tasks. When your async actions return, the system will put your app back into a suspended state. In Widget Extensions, this modifier can be used to handle URL Session background tasks with urlSession.
