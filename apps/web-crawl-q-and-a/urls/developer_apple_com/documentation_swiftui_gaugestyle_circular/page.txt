static var circular: CircularGaugeStyle { get }

Discussion
Apply this style to a Gauge or to a view hierarchy that contains gauges using the gaugeStyle(_:) modifier:
Gauge(value: batteryLevel, in: 0...100) {
    Text("Battery Level")
}
.gaugeStyle(.circular)
This style displays the gauge’s currentValueLabel value at the center of the gauge. If you provide minimumValueLabel and maximumValueLabel parameters when you create the gauge, they appear in the opening at the bottom of the ring. Otherwise, the gauge places its label in that location.
