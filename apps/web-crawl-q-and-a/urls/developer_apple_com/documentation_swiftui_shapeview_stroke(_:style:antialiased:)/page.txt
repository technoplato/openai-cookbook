func stroke<S>(
    _ content: S,
    style: StrokeStyle,
    antialiased: Bool = true
) -> StrokeShapeView<Self.Content, S, Self> where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
content
The color or gradient with which to stroke this shape.
style
The stroke characteristics — such as the line’s width and whether the stroke is dashed — that determine how to render this shape.
Return Value
A stroked shape.
Discussion
The following example adds a dashed purple stroke to a Capsule:
Capsule()
.stroke(
    Color.purple,
    style: StrokeStyle(
        lineWidth: 5,
        lineCap: .round,
        lineJoin: .miter,
        miterLimit: 0,
        dash: [5, 10],
        dashPhase: 0
    )
)
