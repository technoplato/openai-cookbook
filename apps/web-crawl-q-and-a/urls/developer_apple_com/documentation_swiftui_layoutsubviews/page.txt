struct LayoutSubviews
Overview
You receive a LayoutSubviews input to your implementations of Layout protocol methods, like placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:) and sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:). The subviews parameter (which the protocol aliases to the Layout.Subviews type) is a collection that contains proxies for the layout’s subviews (of type LayoutSubview). The proxies appear in the collection in the same order that they appear in the ViewBuilder input to the layout container. Use the proxies to perform layout operations.
Access the proxies in the collection as you would the contents of any Swift random-access collection. For example, you can enumerate all of the subviews and their indices to inspect or operate on them:
for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {
    // ...
}
Topics
Getting the layout direction
var layoutDirection: LayoutDirection

Accessing subviews
subscript(Int) -> LayoutSubviews.Element
Gets the subview proxy at a specified index.
subscript<S>(S) -> LayoutSubviews
Gets the subview proxies with the specified indicies.
subscript(Range<Int>) -> LayoutSubviews
Gets the subview proxies in the specified range.
var startIndex: Int
The index of the first subview.
var endIndex: Int
An index that’s one higher than the last subview.
typealias Element
A type that contains a proxy value.
typealias Index
A type that you can use to index proxy values.
