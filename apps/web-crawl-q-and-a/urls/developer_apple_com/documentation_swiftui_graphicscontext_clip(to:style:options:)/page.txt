mutating func clip(

    style: FillStyle = FillStyle(),
    options: GraphicsContext.ClipOptions = ClipOptions()
)
Parameters
path
A Path that defines the shape of the clipping mask.
style
A FillStyle that defines how to rasterize the shape.
options
Clip options that tell SwiftUI how to interpret the path as a clip shape. For example, you can invert the clip shape by setting the inverse option.
Discussion
Call this method to add a shape to the array of clip shapes that the context uses to define a clipping mask. Shapes that you add affect only subsequent drawing operations.
