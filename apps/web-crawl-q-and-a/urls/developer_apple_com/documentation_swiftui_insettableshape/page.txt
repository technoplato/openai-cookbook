Setting the stroke border characteristics
func strokeBorder<S>(S, lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeBorderShapeView<Self, S, EmptyView>
Returns a view that is the result of filling the lineWidth-sized border (aka inner stroke) of self with content. This is equivalent to insetting self by lineWidth / 2 and stroking the resulting shape with lineWidth as the line-width.
Beta
func strokeBorder<S>(S, lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> some View
Returns a view that is the result of filling the lineWidth-sized border (aka inner stroke) of self with content. This is equivalent to insetting self by lineWidth / 2 and stroking the resulting shape with lineWidth as the line-width.
func strokeBorder(lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> some View
Returns a view that is the result of filling the lineWidth-sized border (aka inner stroke) of self with the foreground color. This is equivalent to insetting self by lineWidth / 2 and stroking the resulting shape with lineWidth as the line-width.
func strokeBorder<S>(S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeBorderShapeView<Self, S, EmptyView>
Returns a view that is the result of insetting self by style.lineWidth / 2, stroking the resulting shape with style, and then filling with content.
Beta
func strokeBorder<S>(S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> some View
Returns a view that is the result of insetting self by style.lineWidth / 2, stroking the resulting shape with style, and then filling with content.
func strokeBorder(style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> some View
Returns a view that is the result of insetting self by style.lineWidth / 2, stroking the resulting shape with style, and then filling with the foreground color.
Setting the inset
func inset(by: CGFloat) -> Self.InsetShape
Returns self inset by amount.

Setting a container shape
func containerShape<T>(T) -> some View
Sets the container shape to use for any container relative shape within this view.
struct ContainerRelativeShape
A shape that is replaced by an inset version of the current container shape. If no container shape was defined, is replaced by a rectangle.
