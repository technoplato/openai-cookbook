Instance Method
digitalCrownRotation(_:)
Tracks Digital Crown rotations by updating the specified binding.
watchOS 6.0+
func digitalCrownRotation<V>(_ binding: Binding<V>) -> some View where V : BinaryFloatingPoint
Parameters
binding
A binding to a value that updates as the user rotates the Digital Crown. The implicit range is (-infinity, +infinity).
Discussion
Use this method to receive values on a binding you provide as the user turns the Digital Crown on Apple Watch. The example below receives changes to the binding value, starting at 0.0 and incrementing or decrementing depending on the direction that the user turns the Digital Crown:
struct DigitalCrown: View {
    @State private var crownValue = 0.0


    var body: some View {
        Text("Received Value:\(crownValue, specifier: "%.1f")")
            .focusable()
            .digitalCrownRotation($crownValue)
    }
}
