Type Method
layerShader(_:maxSampleOffset:)
Returns a filter that applies shader to the contents of the source layer.

static func layerShader(
    _ shader: Shader,
    maxSampleOffset: CGSize
) -> GraphicsContext.Filter
Parameters
shader
The shader to apply as a layer effect.
maxSampleOffset
If the shader function samples from the layer at locations not equal to the destination position, this value must specify the maximum sampling distance in each axis, for all source pixels.
Return Value
A filter applies the shader as a layer effect.
Discussion
For a shader function to act as a layer effect it must have a function signature matching:
[[ stitchable ]] half4 name(float2 position,
  SwiftUI::Layer layer, args...)
where position is the user-space coordinates of the destination pixel applied to the shader, and layer is a rasterized subregion of the source layer. args... should be compatible with the uniform arguments bound to shader.
The SwiftUI::Layer type is defined in the <SwiftUI/SwiftUI.h> header file. It exports a single sample() function that returns a linearly-filtered pixel value from a position in the source content, as a premultiplied RGBA pixel value:
namespace SwiftUI {
  struct Layer {
    half4 sample(float2 position) const;
  };
};
The function should return the color mapping to the destination pixel, typically by sampling one or more pixels from layer at location(s) derived from position and them applying some kind of transformation to produce a new color.
