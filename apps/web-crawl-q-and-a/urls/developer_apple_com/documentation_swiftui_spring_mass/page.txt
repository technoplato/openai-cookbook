Instance Property
mass
The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

var mass: Double { get }
Discussion
The default mass is 1. Increasing this value will increase the spring’s effect: the attached object will be subject to more oscillations and greater overshoot, resulting in an increased settling duration. Decreasing the mass will reduce the spring effect: there will be fewer oscillations and a reduced overshoot, resulting in a decreased settling duration.
