Discussion
The accent color is a broad theme color applied to views and controls. You can set it at the application level by specifying an accent color in your app’s asset catalog.
Note
In macOS, SwiftUI applies customization of the accent color only if the user chooses Multicolor under General > Accent color in System Preferences.
The following code renders a Text view using the app’s accent color:
Text("Accent Color")
    .foregroundStyle(Color.accentColor)
