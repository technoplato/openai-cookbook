Structure
NSViewControllerRepresentableContext
Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update your AppKit view controller.
macOS 10.15+
@MainActor
struct NSViewControllerRepresentableContext<ViewController> where ViewController : NSViewControllerRepresentable
Overview
An NSViewControllerRepresentableContext structure contains details about the current state of the system. When creating and updating your view controller, the system creates one of these structures and passes it to the appropriate method of your custom NSViewControllerRepresentable instance. Use the information in this structure to configure your view controller. For example, use the provided environment values to configure the appearance of your view controller and views. Don’t create this structure yourself.
