Instance Method
foregroundStyle(_:_:_:)
Sets the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the foreground style.
iOS 15.0+
iPadOS 15.0+
macOS 12.0+
Mac Catalyst 15.0+
tvOS 15.0+
watchOS 8.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func foregroundStyle<S1, S2, S3>(
    _ primary: S1,
    _ secondary: S2,
    _ tertiary: S3
) -> some View where S1 : ShapeStyle, S2 : ShapeStyle, S3 : ShapeStyle
Parameters
primary
The primary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements. To indicate a specific value, use Color or image(_:sourceRect:scale:), or one of the gradient types, like linearGradient(colors:startPoint:endPoint:). To set a style that’s relative to the containing view’s style, use one of the semantic styles, like primary.
secondary
The secondary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements.
tertiary
The tertiary color or pattern to use when filling in the foreground elements.
Return Value
A view that uses the given foreground styles.
Discussion
SwiftUI uses these styles when rendering child views that don’t have an explicit rendering style, like images, text, shapes, and so on.
Symbol images within the view hierarchy use the palette rendering mode when you apply this modifier, if you don’t explicitly specify another mode.
