func navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(_ width: CGFloat) -> some View
Discussion
Apply this modifier to the content of a column in a NavigationSplitView to specify a fixed preferred width for the column. Use navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min:ideal:max:) if you need to specify a flexible width.
The following example shows a three-column navigation split view where the first column has a preferred width of 150 points, and the second column has a flexible, preferred width between 150 and 400 points:
NavigationSplitView {
    MySidebar()
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(150)
} contents: {
    MyContents()
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(
            min: 150, ideal: 200, max: 400)
} detail: {
    MyDetail()
}
Only some platforms enable resizing columns. If you specify a width that the current presentation environment doesn’t support, SwiftUI may use a different width for your column.
