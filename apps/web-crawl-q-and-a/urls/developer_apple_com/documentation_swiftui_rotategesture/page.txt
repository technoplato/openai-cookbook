struct RotateGesture
Overview
A rotate gesture tracks how a rotation event sequence changes. To recognize a rotate gesture on a view, create and configure the gesture, and then add it to the view using the gesture(_:including:) modifier.
Add a rotate gesture to a Rectangle and apply a rotation effect:
struct RotateGestureView: View {
    @State private var angle = Angle(degrees: 0.0)


    var rotation: some Gesture {
        RotateGesture()
            .onChanged { value in
                angle = value.rotation
            }
    }


    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200, alignment: .center)
            .rotationEffect(angle)
            .gesture(rotation)
    }
}
