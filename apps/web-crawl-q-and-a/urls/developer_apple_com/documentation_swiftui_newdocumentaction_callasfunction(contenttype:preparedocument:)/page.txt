Instance Method
callAsFunction(contentType:prepareDocument:)
Presents a new document window with preset contents.
SwiftData
SwiftUI
macOS 14.0+ Beta
func callAsFunction(
    contentType: UTType,
    prepareDocument: @escaping (ModelContext) -> Void
)
Parameters
contentType
The content type of the document.
prepareDocument
The closure that accepts ModelContext associated with the new document. Use this closure to set the document‚Äôs initial contents before it is displayed: insert preconfigured models in the provided ModelContext.
Discussion
Don‚Äôt call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the newDocument action.
For example, a Todo app might have a way to create a sample prepopulated Todo list as a part of onboarding experience:
newDocument(contentType: .todoList) { modelContext in
    let todoList = TodoList(
        title: "üé¨ Movie night",
        items: [
            TodoItem(title: "üçø Buy popcorn"),
            TodoItem(title: "üç® Make some ice cream",
            TodoItem(title: "üí° Hang a string of lights")
        ]
    )
    modelContext.insert(todoList)
}
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
