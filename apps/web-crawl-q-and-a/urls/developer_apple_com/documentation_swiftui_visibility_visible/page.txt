Discussion
Some APIs may use this value to represent a hint or preference, rather than a mandatory assertion. For example, setting list row separator visibility to visible using the listRowSeparator(_:edges:) modifier may not always result in any visible separators, especially for list styles that do not include separators as part of their design.
