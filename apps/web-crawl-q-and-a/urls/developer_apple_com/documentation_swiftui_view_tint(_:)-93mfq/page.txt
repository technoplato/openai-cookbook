func tint<S>(_ tint: S?) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
tint
The tint to apply.
Discussion
Use this method to override the default accent color for this view with a given styling. Unlike an app’s accent color, which can be overridden by user preference, tint is always respected and should be used as a way to provide additional meaning to the control.
Controls which are unable to style themselves using the given type of ShapeStyle will try to approximate the styling as best as they can (i.e. controls which can not style themselves using a gradient will attempt to use the color of the gradient’s first stop).
This example shows a linear dashboard styled gauge tinted with a gradient from green to red.
struct ControlTint: View {
    var body: some View {
        Gauge(value: 75, in: 0...100)
            .gaugeStyle(.linearDashboard)
            .tint(Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow, .green]))
    }
}
