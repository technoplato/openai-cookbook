Initializer
init(_:image:isOn:)
Creates a toggle that generates its label from a localized string key and image resource.
iOS 17.0+ Beta
iPadOS 17.0+ Beta
macOS 14.0+ Beta
Mac Catalyst 17.0+ Beta
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
watchOS 10.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    _ titleKey: LocalizedStringKey,
    image: ImageResource,
    isOn: Binding<Bool>
)
Available when Label is Label<Text, Image>.
Parameters
titleKey
The key for the toggle’s localized title, that describes the purpose of the toggle.
image
The name of the image resource to lookup.
isOn
A binding to a property that indicates whether the toggle is on or off.
Discussion
This initializer creates a Text view on your behalf, and treats the localized key similar to init(_:tableName:bundle:comment:). See Text for more information about localizing strings.
To initialize a toggle with a string variable, use init(_:isOn:) instead.
