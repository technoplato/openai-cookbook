Topics
Getting the options
static let requiresActivation: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions
Prevents touch passthrough with the direct touch area until an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver, has activated the direct touch area through a user action, for example a double tap.
static let silentOnTouch: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions
Allows a direct touch area to immediately receive touch events without an assitive technology, such as VoiceOver, speaking. Appropriate for apps that provide direct audio feedback on touch that would conflict with speech feedback.
Creating a set of options

Making gestures accessible
func accessibilityActivationPoint(CGPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.
func accessibilityActivationPoint(UnitPoint) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.
func accessibilityDirectTouch(Bool, options: AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.
Beta
func accessibilityZoomAction((AccessibilityZoomGestureAction) -> Void) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
Adds an accessibility zoom action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.
struct AccessibilityZoomGestureAction
Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.
