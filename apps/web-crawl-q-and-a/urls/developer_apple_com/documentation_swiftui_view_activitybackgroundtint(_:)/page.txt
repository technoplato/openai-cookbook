func activityBackgroundTint(_ color: Color?) -> some View
Parameters
color
The background tint color to apply. To use the system’s default background material, pass nil.
Discussion
When you set a custom background tint color, consider setting a custom text color for the auxiliary button people use to end a Live Activity on the Lock Screen. To set a custom text color, use the activitySystemActionForegroundColor(_:) view modifier.
