Discussion
This hierarchical style maps to the second level of the current foreground style, or to the second level of the default foreground style if you haven’t set a foreground style in the view’s environment. You typically set a foreground style by supplying a non-hierarchical style to the foregroundStyle(_:) modifier.
For information about how to use shape styles, see ShapeStyle.
