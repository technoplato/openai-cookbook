Open Menu
Swift
Type Property
automatic
The default menu style, based on the menu’s context.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
tvOS 17.0+ Beta
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
static var automatic: DefaultMenuStyle { get }
Available when Self is DefaultMenuStyle.
Discussion
The default menu style can vary by platform. By default, macOS uses the bordered button style.
If you create a menu inside a container, the style resolves to the recommended style for menus inside that container for that specific platform. For example, a menu nested within another menu will resolve to a submenu:
Menu("Edit") {
    Menu("Arrange") {
        Button("Bring to Front", action: moveSelectionToFront)
        Button("Send to Back", action: moveSelectionToBack)
    }
    Button("Delete", action: deleteSelection)
}
You can override a menu’s style. To apply the default style to a menu, or to a view that contains a menu, use the menuStyle(_:) modifier.
