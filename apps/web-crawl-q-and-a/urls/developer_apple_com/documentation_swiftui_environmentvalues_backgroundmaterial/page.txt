var backgroundMaterial: Material? { get set }
Discussion
This value is nil if the current background isn’t one of the standard materials. If you set a material, the standard content styles enable their vibrant rendering modes.
You set this value by calling one of the background modifiers that takes a ShapeStyle, like background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:) or background(_:in:fillStyle:), and passing in a Material. You can also set the value manually, using nil to disable vibrant rendering, or a Material instance to enable the vibrancy style associated with the specified material.
