Discussion
If you create a button directly on a blank canvas, the style varies by platform. iOS uses the borderless button style by default, whereas macOS, tvOS, and watchOS use the bordered button style.
If you create a button inside a container, like a List, the style resolves to the recommended style for buttons inside that container for that specific platform.
You can override a button’s style. To apply the default style to a button, or to a view that contains buttons, use the buttonStyle(_:) modifier.
