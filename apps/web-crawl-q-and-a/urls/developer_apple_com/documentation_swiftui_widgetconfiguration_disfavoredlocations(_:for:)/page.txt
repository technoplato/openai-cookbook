Discussion
A widget can appear in different contexts on different platforms. For example, a small system widget appears by default on the Home Screen and in Today View on iPhone, on the iPad Lock Screen, and so on. This gives more people opportunity to view data and functionality that your widget provides. However, some widgets may not work well in a location. For example, a widget that heavily relies on high-resolution photos and background colors for its functionality may not work well on the Lock Screen where the system applies a vibrant treatment to the widget. To tell the system that the widget gallery shouldn’t suggest a widget as preferred for a specific location, you can mark it as disfavored for locations.
The following code snippet tells the system to disfavor the small system family widget from the WidgetLocation/lockScreen and WidgetLocation/homeScreen locations.
lockScreenOnlyConfig
    .disfavoredLocations([.lockScreen, .homeScreen], for: [.systemSmall])
You can use subsequent calls to disfavoredLocations(_:families:) to join them and set disfavored locations for different families:
widgetConfig
    .disfavoredLocations([.lockScreen, .homeScreen], for: [.systemSmall])
    .disfavoredLocations([.homescreen], for: [.systemMedium])
