func onTapGesture(
    count: Int = 1,
    perform action: @escaping () -> Void
) -> some View
Parameters
count
The number of taps or clicks required to trigger the action closure provided in action. Defaults to 1.
action
The action to perform.
Discussion
Use this method to perform the specified action when the user clicks or taps on the view or container count times.
Note
If you create a control that’s functionally equivalent to a Button, use ButtonStyle to create a customized button instead.
In the example below, the color of the heart images changes to a random color from the colors array whenever the user clicks or taps on the view twice:
struct TapGestureExample: View {
    let colors: [Color] = [.gray, .red, .orange, .yellow,
                           .green, .blue, .purple, .pink]
    @State private var fgColor: Color = .gray


    var body: some View {
        Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
            .resizable()
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
            .foregroundColor(fgColor)
            .onTapGesture(count: 2) {
                fgColor = colors.randomElement()!
            }
    }
}
