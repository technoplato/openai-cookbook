struct LazyVStack<Content> where Content : View
Overview
The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.
In the following example, a ScrollView contains a LazyVStack that consists of a vertical row of text views. The stack aligns to the leading edge of the scroll view, and uses default spacing between the text views.
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(alignment: .leading) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Row \($0)")
        }
    }
}
