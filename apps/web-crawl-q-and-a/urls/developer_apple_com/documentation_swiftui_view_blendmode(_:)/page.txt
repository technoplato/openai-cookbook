Instance Method
blendMode(_:)
Sets the blend mode for compositing this view with overlapping views.

tvOS 13.0+

func blendMode(_ blendMode: BlendMode) -> some View
Parameters
blendMode
The BlendMode for compositing this view.
Return Value
A view that applies blendMode to this view.
Discussion
Use blendMode(_:) to combine overlapping views and use a different visual effect to produce the result. The BlendMode enumeration defines many possible effects.
In the example below, the two overlapping rectangles have a BlendMode.colorBurn effect applied, which effectively removes the non-overlapping portion of the second image:
HStack {
    Color.yellow.frame(width: 50, height: 50, alignment: .center)


    Color.red.frame(width: 50, height: 50, alignment: .center)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(45))
        .padding(-20)
        .blendMode(.colorBurn)
}
