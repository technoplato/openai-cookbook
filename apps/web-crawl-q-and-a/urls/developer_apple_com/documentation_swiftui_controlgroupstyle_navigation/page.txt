Discussion
Use this style to group controls related to navigation, such as back/forward buttons or timeline navigation controls.
The navigation control group style can vary by platform. On iOS, it renders as individual borderless buttons, while on macOS, it displays as a separated momentary segmented control.
To apply this style to a control group or to a view that contains a control group, use the controlGroupStyle(_:) modifier.
