Discussion
A primary action is a more frequently used action for the current context. For example, a button the user clicks or taps to compose a new message in a chat app.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the location for the primary action is the leading edge of the toolbar.
In iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS, the location for the primary action is the trailing edge of the navigation bar.
In watchOS the system places the primary action beneath the navigation bar; the user reveals the action by scrolling.
