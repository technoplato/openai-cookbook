) -> EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule.Entries
Parameters
startDate
The date from which the sequence begins.
mode
The mode for the update schedule.
Return Value

Discussion
A TimelineView that you create with an every minute schedule calls this method to ask the schedule when to update its content. The method returns a sequence of per-minute dates in increasing order, from earliest to latest, that represents when the timeline view updates.
For a startDate that’s exactly minute-aligned, the schedule’s sequence of dates starts at that time. Otherwise, it starts at the beginning of the specified minute. For example, for start dates of both 10:09:32 and 10:09:00, the first entry in the sequence is 10:09:00.
