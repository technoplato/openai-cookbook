Discussion
If you develop your view or shape in an LTR context, you can use .mirrors(in: .rightToLeft) (which is equivalent to .mirrors) to mirror your content when the layout direction is RTL (and keep the original version in LTR). If you developer in an RTL context, you can use .mirrors(in: .leftToRight) to mirror your content when the layout direction is LTR (and keep the original version in RTL).
