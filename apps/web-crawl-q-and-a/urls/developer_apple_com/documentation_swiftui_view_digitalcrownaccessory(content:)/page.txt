The view to be used as a Digital Crown Accessory.
Discussion
Use this method to place a custom View next to the Digital Crown on Apple Watch. Use digitalCrownAccessory(_:) to specify the visibility of your custom view.
struct ZoomingMapView: View {
    // Width of the map displayed on screen in miles
    @State private var zoomLevel: Int = 1.0


    var body: some View {
        CustomMap(width: .miles(zoomLevel))
            .focusable()
            .digitalCrownRotation(value: $zoomLevel)
            .digitalCrownAccessory {
                Text("\(zoomLevel, specifier: "%.2f")MI")
                .background {
                    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 5)
                        .fill(Color.gray)
                }
            }
