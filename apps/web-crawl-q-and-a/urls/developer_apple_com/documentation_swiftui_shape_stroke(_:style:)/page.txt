Instance Method
stroke(_:style:)
Traces the outline of this shape with a color or gradient.

func stroke<S>(
    _ content: S,
    style: StrokeStyle
) -> some View where S : ShapeStyle
Parameters
content
The color or gradient with which to stroke this shape.
style
The stroke characteristics — such as the line’s width and whether the stroke is dashed — that determine how to render this shape.
Return Value
A stroked shape.
Discussion
The following example adds a dashed purple stroke to a Capsule:
Capsule()
.stroke(
    Color.purple,
    style: StrokeStyle(
        lineWidth: 5,
        lineCap: .round,
        lineJoin: .miter,
        miterLimit: 0,
        dash: [5, 10],
        dashPhase: 0
    )
)

func stroke<S>(S, lineWidth: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeShapeView<Self, S, EmptyView>

Beta
func stroke(lineWidth: CGFloat) -> some Shape
Returns a new shape that is a stroked copy of self with line-width defined by lineWidth and all other properties of StrokeStyle having their default values.
func stroke<S>(S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> StrokeShapeView<Self, S, EmptyView>
Traces the outline of this shape with a color or gradient.
Beta
func stroke(style: StrokeStyle) -> some Shape
Returns a new shape that is a stroked copy of self, using the contents of style to define the stroke characteristics.
