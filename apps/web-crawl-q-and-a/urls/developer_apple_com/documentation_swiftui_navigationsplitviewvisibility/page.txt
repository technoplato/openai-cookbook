struct NavigationSplitViewVisibility
Overview
Use a value of this type to control the visibility of the columns of a NavigationSplitView. Create a State property with a value of this type, and pass a Binding to that state to the init(columnVisibility:sidebar:detail:) or init(columnVisibility:sidebar:content:detail:) initializer when you create the navigation split view. You can then modify the value elsewhere in your code to:
Hide all but the trailing column with detailOnly.
Hide the leading column of a three-column navigation split view with doubleColumn.
Show all the columns with all.
Rely on the automatic behavior for the current context with automatic.
Note
Some platforms don’t respect every option. For example, macOS always displays the content column.
Topics
Getting visibilities
static var automatic: NavigationSplitViewVisibility
Use the default leading column visibility for the current device.
static var all: NavigationSplitViewVisibility
Show all the columns of a three-column navigation split view.
static var doubleColumn: NavigationSplitViewVisibility
Show the content column and detail area of a three-column navigation split view, or the sidebar column and detail area of a two-column navigation split view.
static var detailOnly: NavigationSplitViewVisibility
Hide the leading two columns of a three-column navigation split view, so that just the detail area shows.
