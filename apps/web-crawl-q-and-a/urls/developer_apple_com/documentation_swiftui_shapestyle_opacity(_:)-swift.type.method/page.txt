static func opacity(_ opacity: Double) -> some ShapeStyle
Available when Self is AnyShapeStyle.
Discussion
In most contexts the current style is the foreground but e.g. when setting the value of the background style, that becomes the current implicit style.
For example, a circle filled with the current foreground style at fifty-percent opacity:
Circle().fill(.opacity(0.5))
