Discussion
Destructive actions represent the opposite of a confirmation action. For example, a button labeled “Don’t Save” that allows the user to discard unsaved changes to a document before quitting.
In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places destructiveAction items in the leading edge of the sheet and gives them a special appearance to caution against accidental use.
In iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, the system places destructiveAction items in the trailing edge of the navigation bar.
