Initializer
init(_:)
Creates a group box based on a style configuration.
iOS 14.0+
iPadOS 14.0+
macOS 11.0+
Mac Catalyst 14.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(_ configuration: GroupBoxStyleConfiguration)
Available when Label is GroupBoxStyleConfiguration.Label and Content is GroupBoxStyleConfiguration.Content.
Parameters
configuration
The properties of the group box instance being created.
Discussion
Use this initializer within the makeBody(configuration:) method of a GroupBoxStyle instance to create a styled group box, with customizations, while preserving its existing style.
The following example adds a pink border around the group box, without overriding its current style:
struct PinkBorderGroupBoxStyle: GroupBoxStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        GroupBox(configuration)
            .border(Color.pink)
    }
}
