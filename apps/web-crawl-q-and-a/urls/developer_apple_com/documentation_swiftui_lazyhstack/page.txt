struct LazyHStack<Content> where Content : View
Overview
The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.
In the following example, a ScrollView contains a LazyHStack that consists of a horizontal row of text views. The stack aligns to the top of the scroll view and uses 10-point spacing between each text view.
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 10) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Column \($0)")
        }
    }
}
