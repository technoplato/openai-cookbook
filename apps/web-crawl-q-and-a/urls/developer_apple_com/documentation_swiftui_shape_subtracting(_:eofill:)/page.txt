Instance Method
subtracting(_:eoFill:)
Returns a new shape with filled regions from this shape that are not in the given shape.

func subtracting<T>(
    _ other: T,
    eoFill: Bool = false
) -> some Shape where T : Shape
Parameters
other
The shape to subtract.
eoFill
Whether to use the even-odd rule for determining which areas to treat as the interior of the shapes (if true), or the non-zero rule (if false).
Return Value
A new shape.
Discussion
The filled region of the resulting shape is the filled region of this shape with the filled region other removed from it.
Any unclosed subpaths in either shape are assumed to be closed. The result of filling this shape using either even-odd or non-zero fill rules is identical.
