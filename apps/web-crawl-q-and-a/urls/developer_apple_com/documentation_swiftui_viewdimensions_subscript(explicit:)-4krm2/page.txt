subscript(explicit guide: VerticalAlignment) -> CGFloat? { get }
Overview
Find the vertical offset of a particular guide in the corresponding view by using that guide as an index to read from the context:
.alignmentGuide(.top) { context in
    context[.top] - 10
}
This subscript returns nil if no value exists for the guide.
For information about using subscripts in Swift to access member elements of a collection, list, or, sequence, see Subscripts in The Swift Programming Language.
