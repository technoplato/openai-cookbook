Discussion
A volumetric glass material is a 3D object that includes thickness, specular, glass blur, shadow, and others. Because of its physical depth attribute, it influences Z-axis layout; the UI content should be generally placed within the glass background, instead of on top of it as when using layouts like View/overlay or ZStack.
