A layout to use for preview.

Discussion
By default, previews use the PreviewLayout/device layout, which places the view inside a visual representation of the chosen device. You can instead tell a preview to use a different layout by choosing one of the PreviewLayout values, like PreviewLayout/sizeThatFits:
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)
    }
}
