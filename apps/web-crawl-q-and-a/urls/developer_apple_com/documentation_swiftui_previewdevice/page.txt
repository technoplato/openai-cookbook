struct PreviewDevice
Overview
Create a preview device by name, like “iPhone X”, or by model number, like “iPad8,1”. Use the device in a call to the previewDevice(_:) modifier to set a preview device that doesn’t change when you change the run destination in Xcode:
struct CircleImage_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        CircleImage()
            .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPad Pro (11-inch)"))
    }
}
You can get a list of supported preview device names by using the xcrun command in the Terminal app:
% xcrun simctl list devicetypes
Additionally, you can use the following values for macOS platform development:
“Mac”
“Mac Catalyst”
