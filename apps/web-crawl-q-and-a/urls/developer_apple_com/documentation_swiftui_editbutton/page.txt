struct EditButton
Overview
An edit button toggles the environment’s editMode value for content within a container that supports edit mode. In the following example, an edit button placed inside a NavigationView supports editing of a List:
@State private var fruits = [
    "Apple",
    "Banana",
    "Papaya",
    "Mango"
]


var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
        List {
            ForEach(fruits, id: \.self) { fruit in
                Text(fruit)
            }
            .onDelete { fruits.remove(atOffsets: $0) }
            .onMove { fruits.move(fromOffsets: $0, toOffset: $1) }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Fruits")
        .toolbar {
            EditButton()
        }
    }
}
Because the ForEach in the above example defines behaviors for onDelete(perform:) and onMove(perform:), the editable list displays the delete and move UI when the user taps Edit. Notice that the Edit button displays the title “Done” while edit mode is active:
You can also create custom views that react to changes in the edit mode state, as described in EditMode.
