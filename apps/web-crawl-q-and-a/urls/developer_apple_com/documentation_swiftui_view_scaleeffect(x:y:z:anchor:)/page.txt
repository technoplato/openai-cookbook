Instance Method
scaleEffect(x:y:z:anchor:)
Scales this view by the specified horizontal, vertical, and depth factors.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
func scaleEffect(
    x: CGFloat = 1.0,
    y: CGFloat = 1.0,
    z: CGFloat = 1.0,
    anchor: UnitPoint3D = .center
) -> some View
Parameters
x
The horizontal scale factor for this view.
y
The vertical scale factor for this view.
z
The depth scale factor for this view.
anchor
The anchor point about which to scale the view. Defaults to center.
Return Value
A view that scales this view by x,y, and z.
Discussion
The original dimensions of the view are considered to be unchanged by scaling the contents. To change the dimensions of the view, use a modifier like frame() instead.
