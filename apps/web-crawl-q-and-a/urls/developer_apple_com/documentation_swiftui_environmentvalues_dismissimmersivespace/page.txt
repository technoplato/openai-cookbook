Instance Property
dismissImmersiveSpace
An immersive space dismissal action stored in a view’s environment.
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
var dismissImmersiveSpace: DismissImmersiveSpaceAction { get }
Discussion
The call returns once the immersive space is dismissed.
Use the dismissImmersiveSpace environment value to get an DismissImmersiveSpaceAction instance for a given Environment. Then call the instance to dismiss a space. You call the instance directly because it defines a callAsFunction() method that Swift calls when you call the instance.
For example, you can define a button that dismisses an immersive space:
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        ImmersiveSpace(id: "solarSystem") {
            SolarSystemView()
        }
    }
}


struct DismissImmersiveSpaceButton: View {
    @Environment(\.dismissImmersiveSpace)
    private var dismissImmersiveSpace


    var body: some View {
        Button("Close Solar System Immersive Space") {
            Task {
                await dismissImmersiveSpace()
                print("Dismissing complete")
            }
        }
    }
}
