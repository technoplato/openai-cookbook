Structure
NSViewRepresentableContext
Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update your AppKit view.
macOS 10.15+
@MainActor
struct NSViewRepresentableContext<View> where View : NSViewRepresentable
Overview
An NSViewRepresentableContext structure contains details about the current state of the system. When creating and updating your view, the system creates one of these structures and passes it to the appropriate method of your custom NSViewRepresentable instance. Use the information in this structure to configure your view. For example, use the provided environment values to configure the appearance of your view. Don’t create this structure yourself.
