Overview

Topics
Getting built-in transitions
static let identity: AnyTransition
A transition that returns the input view, unmodified, as the output view.
static func move(edge: Edge) -> AnyTransition
Returns a transition that moves the view away, towards the specified edge of the view.
static func offset(CGSize) -> AnyTransition
static func offset(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) -> AnyTransition
static let opacity: AnyTransition
A transition from transparent to opaque on insertion, and from opaque to transparent on removal.
static func push(from: Edge) -> AnyTransition
Creates a transition that when added to a view will animate the view’s insertion by moving it in from the specified edge while fading it in, and animate its removal by moving it out towards the opposite edge and fading it out.
static var scale: AnyTransition
Returns a transition that scales the view.
static func scale(scale: CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint) -> AnyTransition
Returns a transition that scales the view by the specified amount.
static var slide: AnyTransition
A transition that inserts by moving in from the leading edge, and removes by moving out towards the trailing edge.
Combining and configuring transitions
func animation(Animation?) -> AnyTransition
Attaches an animation to this transition.
static func asymmetric(insertion: AnyTransition, removal: AnyTransition) -> AnyTransition
Provides a composite transition that uses a different transition for insertion versus removal.
func combined(with: AnyTransition) -> AnyTransition
Combines this transition with another, returning a new transition that is the result of both transitions being applied.
Creating a custom transition
init<T>(T)
Create an instance that type-erases transition.
Beta
static func modifier<E>(active: E, identity: E) -> AnyTransition
Returns a transition defined between an active modifier and an identity modifier.

Defining transitions
func transition<T>(T) -> some View
Associates a transition with the view.
Beta
func transition(AnyTransition) -> some View
Associates a transition with the view.
protocol Transition
A description of view changes to apply when a view is added to and removed from the view hierarchy.
Beta
struct TransitionProperties
The properties a Transition can have.
Beta
enum TransitionPhase
An indication of which the current stage of a transition.
Beta
struct AsymmetricTransition
A composite Transition that uses a different transition for insertion versus removal.
Beta
func contentTransition(ContentTransition) -> some View
Modifies the view to use a given transition as its method of animating changes to the contents of its views.
var contentTransition: ContentTransition
The current method of animating the contents of views.
var contentTransitionAddsDrawingGroup: Bool
A Boolean value that controls whether views that render content transitions use GPU-accelerated rendering.
struct ContentTransition
A kind of transition that applies to the content within a single view, rather than to the insertion or removal of a view.
struct PlaceholderContentView
A placeholder used to construct an inline modifier, transition, or other helper type.
