Discussion
Don’t call this method directly. SwiftUI calls it when you call the openWindow action with a value:
openWindow(value: message.id)
For information about how Swift uses the callAsFunction() method to simplify call site syntax, see Methods with Special Names in The Swift Programming Language.
