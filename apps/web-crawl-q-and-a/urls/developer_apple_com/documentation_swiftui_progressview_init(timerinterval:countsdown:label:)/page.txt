Initializer
init(timerInterval:countsDown:label:)
Creates a progress view for showing continuous progress as time passes, with a descriptive label.
iOS 16.0+
iPadOS 16.0+
macOS 13.0+
Mac Catalyst 16.0+
tvOS 16.0+
watchOS 9.0+
visionOS 1.0+ Beta
init(
    timerInterval: ClosedRange<Date>,
    countsDown: Bool = true,
    @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label
)
Available when Label conforms to View and CurrentValueLabel is DefaultDateProgressLabel.
Parameters
timerInterval
The date range over which the view progresses.
countsDown
A Boolean value that determines whether the view empties or fills as time passes. If true (the default), the view empties.
label
An optional view that describes the purpose of the progress view.
Discussion
Use this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of start...end, where start is 30 seconds in the past and end is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete. This example also provides a custom descriptive label.
struct ContentView: View {
    let start = Date().addingTimeInterval(-30)
    let end = Date().addingTimeInterval(90)


    var body: some View {
        ProgressView(interval: start...end,
                     countsDown: false) {
            Text("Progress")
         }
    }
}
By default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the countsDown parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.
The progress view provided by this initializer uses a text label that automatically updates to describe the current time remaining. To provide a custom label to show the current value, use init(value:total:label:currentValueLabel:) instead.
Note
Date-relative progress views, such as those created with this initializer, don’t support custom styles.
