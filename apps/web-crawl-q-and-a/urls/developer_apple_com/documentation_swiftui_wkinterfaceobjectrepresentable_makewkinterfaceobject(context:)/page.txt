Instance Method
makeWKInterfaceObject(context:)
Creates a WatchKit interface object and configures its initial state.
watchOS 6.0+
@MainActor
func makeWKInterfaceObject(context: Self.Context) -> Self.WKInterfaceObjectType
Required
Parameters
context
A context structure containing information about the current state of the system.
Return Value
Your interface object configured with the provided information.
Discussion
You must implement this method and use it to create your interface object. Configure the object using your app’s current data and contents of the context parameter. The system calls this method only once, when it creates your interface object for the first time. For all subsequent updates, the system calls the updateWKInterfaceObject(_:context:) method.
